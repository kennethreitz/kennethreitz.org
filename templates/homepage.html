    <p>I'm a believer in the profound power of elegant simplicity.<label for="sn-simplicity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-simplicity" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">This philosophy traces back to the Unix principle: "Do one thing and do it well," but extends to the entire user experience.</span> When I set out to create Requests, 
    I wasn't just solving HTTP in Python—I was making a statement about what software could be. 
    Beautiful. Intuitive. Joyful to use.</p>
    
    <p>My journey through technology has taught me that the most impactful innovations don't just work—they 
    <em>feel right</em>. From the first line of Requests to the architectural decisions in Certifi, 
    every choice reflects a core belief: developers are humans first, and our tools should honor that humanity.<label for="sn-humanity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-humanity" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">This human-centered approach influences everything from API design to error messages and documentation structure.</span></p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-downloads" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">Combined daily downloads across Requests (~25M) and Certifi (~20M) based on PyPI statistics.</span> and the libraries that power much of the modern web, I'm passionate 
    about mental health awareness, the philosophy of consciousness, music production, and exploring how 
    artificial intelligence might reshape our understanding of what it means to think and create.</p>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Every line of code I write is guided by a simple principle: technology should amplify human potential, not complicate it.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="newthought">Simplicity</span> is the ultimate sophistication.<label for="sn-da-vinci" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-da-vinci" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">Often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, though the exact origin is disputed. The sentiment perfectly captures the essence of elegant design.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This isn't just about clean APIs or elegant syntax. It's about recognizing that behind every <code>import requests</code> is a human being trying to solve a problem, build something meaningful, or maybe just get home to their family a little earlier.</p>
    
    <p>When millions of developers trust your code to power their applications, you carry a responsibility that goes beyond functionality. You're shaping how people think about problems, how they approach solutions, and ultimately, how they feel about their craft.<label for="sn-responsibility" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-responsibility" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">This philosophy extends beyond code to documentation, community building, and the entire developer experience ecosystem.</span></p>

    <h2>The Human Behind the Code</h2>
    <p>I believe in radical transparency, authentic vulnerability, and the power of community.<label for="sn-transparency" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-transparency" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">This includes openly discussing mental health challenges, sharing creative processes, and being honest about both successes and failures.</span> 
    Whether I'm debugging a gnarly HTTP edge case, crafting a new electronic track, or 
    sharing my experiences with mental health, I approach everything with curiosity, 
    empathy, and a deep respect for the humans I'm fortunate enough to serve through my work.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always excited to connect with fellow creators, dreamers, and builders. 
    Whether you want to discuss API design philosophy, share your latest project, 
    or just say hello—I believe the best innovations emerge from authentic human connections.<label for="sn-connection" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-connection" class="margin-toggle"/>
