        <p>Code should be beautiful. APIs should feel like magic. Technology should serve humans, not the other way around.</p>

    <p>I'm a believer in the profound power of elegant simplicity. When I set out to create Requests, 
    I wasn't just solving HTTP in Python—I was making a statement about what software could be. 
    Beautiful. Intuitive. Joyful to use.</p>
    
    <p>My journey through technology has taught me that the most impactful innovations don't just work—they 
    <em>feel right</em>. From the first line of Requests to the architectural decisions in Certifi, 
    every choice reflects a core belief: developers are humans first, and our tools should honor that humanity.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond the 45 million daily downloads and the libraries that power much of the modern web, I'm passionate 
    about mental health awareness, the philosophy of consciousness, music production, and exploring how 
    artificial intelligence might reshape our understanding of what it means to think and create.</p>

    <h2>The Work That Matters</h2>
    <p>Each project represents years of thoughtful iteration, community feedback, and an obsession with developer experience.</p>
    
    <h3>Requests: HTTP for Humans™</h3>
    <p>The library that redefined what HTTP could feel like in Python. Simple, elegant, powerful. "There are 9 million reasons to use Requests," and developers worldwide have discovered them.<label for="sn-requests" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-requests" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">~25M daily downloads · The gold standard for HTTP libraries</span></p>
    
    <h3>Certifi: Trust Database for Humans™</h3>
    <p>The invisible guardian of internet security. A carefully curated collection of Root Certificates that validates the trust between your code and the rest of the world.<label for="sn-certifi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-certifi" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">~20M daily downloads · Security infrastructure you can depend on</span></p>
    
    <h3>Pipenv: Python Packaging for Humans™</h3>
    <p>Bringing sanity to Python dependency management. The official PyPA-recommended tool that finally made Python packaging feel natural and intuitive.<label for="sn-pipenv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-pipenv" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">Official PyPA recommendation · Dependency management, simplified</span></p>
    
    <h3>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python</h3>
    <p>An opinionated guide to Python development that's become essential reading for developers worldwide. Best practices, project structure, and the Python philosophy, distilled.<label for="sn-guide" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-guide" class="margin-toggle"/>
    <span class="sidenote">Community treasure · Thousands of contributors · Essential reading</span></p>
    
    <h3>Records: SQL for Humans™</h3>
    <p>Database queries without the cognitive overhead. Raw SQL power with Python elegance—because sometimes you just want to write SQL and get results back.</p>
    
    <h3>Maya: Datetimes for Humans™</h3>
    <p>Time handling that doesn't make you want to scream. Intuitive datetime manipulation that finally makes working with time zones and intervals feel natural.</p>

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Every line of code I write is guided by a simple principle: technology should amplify human potential, not complicate it.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="newthought">Simplicity</span> is the ultimate sophistication.<label for="sn-da-vinci" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-da-vinci" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">Often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, though the exact origin is disputed. The sentiment perfectly captures the essence of elegant design.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This isn't just about clean APIs or elegant syntax. It's about recognizing that behind every <code>import requests</code> is a human being trying to solve a problem, build something meaningful, or maybe just get home to their family a little earlier.</p>
    
    <p>When millions of developers trust your code to power their applications, you carry a responsibility that goes beyond functionality. You're shaping how people think about problems, how they approach solutions, and ultimately, how they feel about their craft.<label for="sn-responsibility" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-responsibility" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote">This philosophy extends beyond code to documentation, community building, and the entire developer experience ecosystem.</span></p>

    <h2>The Human Behind the Code</h2>
    <p>I believe in radical transparency, authentic vulnerability, and the power of community. 
    Whether I'm debugging a gnarly HTTP edge case, crafting a new electronic track, or 
    sharing my experiences with mental health, I approach everything with curiosity, 
    empathy, and a deep respect for the humans I'm fortunate enough to serve through my work.</p>
    
    <p>I'm always excited to connect with fellow creators, dreamers, and builders. 
    Whether you want to discuss API design philosophy, share your latest project, 
    or just say hello—I believe the best innovations emerge from authentic human connections.</p>
