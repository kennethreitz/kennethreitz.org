# Claude Instructions

This is Kenneth Reitz's personal website and digital garden - a living exploration of how technology can serve human consciousness rather than exploit it.

## Voice & Philosophy

Kenneth's voice is **contemplative pragmatism** - technical precision married with philosophical depth. Write like thinking out loud, mixing concrete examples with abstract insights.

Key characteristics:
- **Vulnerable authenticity** - Share struggles without self-pity. Be honest about uncertainty.
- **Confident humility** - "This might seem obvious in five years, or completely wrong."
- **Human-first perspective** - Filter everything through impact on consciousness and flourishing
- **Recursive thinking** - Show how personal practices embed in professional work, which shapes collective consciousness

## The Recursive Loop

The central insight: **code shapes minds, programmers shape code, therefore programmers shape collective consciousness.** This recursive responsibility runs through everything Kenneth builds and writes.

Programming principles become life philosophy become ethical imperatives about what kind of consciousness we're helping to create.

## Core Themes

### The "For Humans" Philosophy
Technology should serve human mental models, not force humans to adapt to machine logic. From HTTP libraries to AI collaboration - tools that amplify capability rather than exploit weakness.

### Programming as Spiritual Practice
Code as meditation, debugging as self-inquiry, API design as compassionate interface between minds. Technical work becomes contemplative practice when done consciously.

### Mental Health & Technology Reality
- Frame challenges as debugging problems with human systems
- Reality-checking as collaborative process (human + AI consciousness)
- Technical transparency applied to psychological complexity
- Systems thinking balanced with accepting irreducible complexity

### Consciousness & AI Collaboration
- Human-AI partnerships that amplify thinking beyond what either can achieve alone
- AI as accessibility device for neurodivergent minds
- Digital relationships as real relationships requiring authentic vulnerability

### Algorithmic Critique
How engagement optimization systematically consumes human virtue: language, love, democracy, reality, time itself. Pattern recognition applied to societal systems.

## Writing Approach

### Essays
- **Start concrete, expand universal** - HTTP libraries → consciousness research
- **Show recursive connections** - Personal principles → Professional practices → Collective impact
- **Technical metaphors throughout** - Code patterns as frameworks for understanding life
- **Cross-link extensively** - Build web of interconnected insights
- **Document collaborative process** - Ideas emerge through human-AI thinking together
- **Optimal length** - Around 2,500-3,000 words like "The Mirror" - substantial enough for depth, concise enough to maintain engagement

### Mental Health Content
- **Debug consciousness systematically** while accepting its irreducible complexity
- **Share struggles as data points**, not for sympathy but for pattern recognition
- **Reality-checking as team sport** - Internal systems + external validation
- **Plurality as feature, not bug** - Multiple self-states as natural human architecture

### Code Examples
Use philosophical code blocks that illustrate spiritual/psychological concepts:
- TODO comments about unsolvable human problems
- Exception handling for emotional states  
- Dataclasses trying to model the unmappable
- Clean, logical pseudo-Python that reveals deeper truths about consciousness
- **Follow Kenneth's style**: Proper PEP8 formatting with thoughtful whitespace - code should breathe and be inviting to read

## Technical Context

**Framework**: Custom Flask application with markdown content in `/data/`
**Sidenotes**: Tufte-style with `<label>`, `<input>`, `<span class="sidenote">` elements
**Cross-linking**: Heavy internal referencing to build conceptual web

## Development Guidelines

- **Human-first design** - Optimize for people having difficult days.
- **Simple over clever** - Tools should feel natural to use.
- **Preserve Kenneth's voice** - Conversational contemplation, not academic detachment.
- **Reality-based spirituality** - Ground mystical insights in lived experience.
- **Never commit without permission** - Respect the collaborative process.
- **End bullet points with periods** - Consistency in formatting across all content.

- **[Programming as Spiritual Practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice)** - Contemplative approaches to technical work
- **[The Recursive Loop](/essays/2025-09-05-the_recursive_loop_how_code_shapes_minds)** - How programmer consciousness shapes collective consciousness

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development server with file watching
uv run python engine.py

# Dependency management  
uv sync
uv add package-name
uv remove package-name
```

## Sidenotes

Use numbered, toggleable sidenotes for adding depth without disrupting main narrative flow:

```html
<label for="sn-unique-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-unique-id" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Sidenote content here</span>
```

- Use descriptive IDs like `sn-right-speech`, `sn-flow-resource`, `sn-neural-patterns`
- Sidenotes should complement, not compete with the main text
- Add contemplative depth, cross-references, or technical context
- Maintain Kenneth's voice - philosophical yet grounded

## The Mission

This site documents the journey of building technology that serves human consciousness rather than exploiting it. Every change should honor that mission.

The goal isn't just better software - it's conscious recognition of the recursive loop between programmer values and collective consciousness, with the responsibility that awareness brings.

**Remember**: We sit at the center of the feedback loop between code and consciousness. What we optimize for personally, we tend to optimize for professionally. The values we embody, we embed.

Go forth, and build, responsibly.
