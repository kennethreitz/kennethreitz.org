# Fallibilism
*January 2009*





Everyone seems to think that they are always right. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Because they aren't. At all. That's why I'm a falliblist.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Fallibilism, developed by philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce and later refined by Karl Popper, holds that our knowledge is provisional and that we should remain open to revision—a foundational principle in both scientific methodology and effective software development.</span> I believe that others are often right, and since I'm human, and prone to error, I'll always consider *anything* that anyone else has to say.

But hey, *I could be wrong*. :)<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This self-referential paradox—stating fallibilistic belief while acknowledging it could be wrong—beautifully captures the humble yet confident stance that enables continuous learning and intellectual growth.</span>
