# Fallibilism

  Everyone seems to think that they are always right. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Because they aren't. At all. That's why I'm a falliblist. I believe that others are often right, and since I'm human, and prone to error, I'll always consider *anything* that anyone else has to say.  
But hey, *I could be wrong*. :)
