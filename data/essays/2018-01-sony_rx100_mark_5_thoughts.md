So, I did a little bit of research and ended up picking up the fantastic [Sony RX100 Mark 5](http://amzn.to/2DBWvwk), an even smaller camera. My [first photoshoot (nsfw)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kennethreitz/albums/72157689688901522) with the Sony proved it to be a superior camera for my needs.

It's a camera, in every way as much as the [Fuijfilm X100F](http://amzn.to/2F97c5U) is.

It's small, compact, has a reasonable lens (which I keep at 24mm most of the time), and a fantastic sensor. Its color reproduction (the aspect the Panasonic was lacking the most) is top–knotch, potentially beating out even my previous [Fuijfilm X100F](http://amzn.to/2F97c5U).

 It's small enough to easily fit into my pocket, so I always have it with me. Despite reviews to the contrary, I find its battery life to be quite adequate.

It also does the opposite, of course, allowing for me to view the screen while the camera is far below my head, close to the ground. Overall, the screen on this camera is just excellent, especially for the price.  

 ## Conclusion

 Overall, I'm *thrilled* with this purchase, and I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for something small and pocketable.
