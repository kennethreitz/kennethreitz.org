# iPad Apps Worth Lusting For
*January 2010*





  The distaste hackers and developers have towards the iPad was initially understandable. Now that it's out, I think everyone should hold one in their hand before they make any outlandish statements against it. Eric Sink sums it up pretty perfectly.\> Computers, by and large, are still designed for geeks. This is why we all buy T\-shirts that say “No, I will not fix your computer”. The genius of the iPad is that it cannot get things like viruses. It is a closed platform. You can’t put apps on it. You can’t write and distribute software for it without Apple’s permission. This is why geeks hate it and normal people will love it.

The $499 iPad price point, considered steep in 2010, would prove to be transformative for the tablet market. This hesitation reflects the broader tech community's uncertainty about whether tablets would succeed or fail.
