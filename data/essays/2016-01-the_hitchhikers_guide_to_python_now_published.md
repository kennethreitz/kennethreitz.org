It intends to serve as both a guidebook for newcomers to Python and an excellent reference for seasoned veterans.¬†

 The project was, and continues to be, a big success for the Python community. Today, the website receives between **6,000‚Äì13,000 individual visitors every day**. Community contributions, which are encouraged and responsible for the majority of the content, have been made by *over 100 individuals.*¬†

 ## Book Publication with O'Reilly

 I'm very proud, humbled, and excited to announce that, as of this week, ***The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python*** is available for purchase in the form of a classic O'Reilly technical book (animal cover and all)!¬†

 ## ‚ú®¬†Proceeds Donated to Django Girls ‚ú®

 
> *The **Django Girls Foundation** is a Charitable Incorporated Organization (‚Äúthe CIO‚Äù). The goal of the foundation is to advance the education of the public in particular but not exclusively women in the subject of computer science by providing or assisting in the provision of programming workshops and educational material.*

 ## **Lowering the barrier to entry.**

 ## Moving Forward

 I am not aware of any active plans to keep the printed book up\-to\-date with the website, although I'm sure that may be commissioned at some point in the distant future. As for [python\-guide.org](http://python-guide.org), nothing has changed: contributions are still accepted on a regular basis, and the site will only continue to grow in traffic (e.g. value \& usefulness).

 If you'd like to contribute, I heavily encourage you to! Documentation improvement/augmentation is (for me, personally) one of the most simple yet rewarding types of open source contribution. The guide is an opinionated one, so there's always a chance that your suggestions won't be accepted based purely on subjectivity, but‚Äî¬†nearly all pull requests are accepted :)

 ## Special Thanks

 Preparing the documentation/web\-style content for print publication took nearly two years of intensive labor. While I watched/oversaw the entire process, all credit for the actual publication of this book goes to [Tanya Schlusser](https://github.com/tanyaschlusser), who is 100% responsible for making this conversion of content distribution happen.

 Thanks, Tanya.
