I have a deep love for analog synthesizers, drum machines, audio software, and the creation of music. Music is an excellent medium for crafting an image of certain facets of my inner world in a way that I am unable through other avenues, e.g. writing, code, and photography.

 As [**Infinite State**](/music), I have been leisurely creating deeply\-personal music that captures this wide spectrum of imagery over the past several years, a window of time which includes some very dramatic changes in my life (all for the best!). Nothing inspires the creative spirit more than non\-insubstantial change!

 ## **Unmastered Impulses by Infinite State**

 Today, I'm happy to announce that I have released my first album, *[Unmastered Impulses](/unmastered-impulses),* a sonic journal of my journey into bipolar mania.

  ![Available on Spotify ,&nbsp; TIDAL , and SoundCloud .&nbsp;](http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/665498111876725f7613f1e6/1719666489302-RQID2RIZ8DFI8VEB93CZ/74cd6-326ac-image-asset.jpeg)

  *Available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ejOTrNLk9qTzF6uuPn6xw), [TIDAL](http://tidal.com/album/63034611), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/infinitestate/sets/unmastered-impulses).*



   ***Unmastered Impulses* byInfinite State** contains 13 tracks inspired by esoteric spiritual and philosophical concepts, explorations into the dream state, [bipolar disorder](/essays/mentalhealtherror-an-exception-occurred), and [a traumatic relationship](/essays/purging-the-unexpected-negative-a-narcissistic-partner).

 I found it quite difficult to limit myself to the time\-length of a physical [Red Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_Digital_Audio#Standard) CD, and a handful of excellent and important tracks (including one I consider to be my best work) had to be left out of this release, unfortunately. However, this is a blessing in disguise—it means that I'm already pretty far along with this album's successor!

 [Listen Now](/unmastered-impulses) ## **Where to Get It**

 The album is intended to be completely free, and should be entirely available on all major streaming services and online music stores. Here are a few links to the most common ones:

A few platforms have received the album but not made it available quite yet — but, it will be ubiquitously available within the next few weeks. 

 If you see a fee attached to procuring the music (e.g. [Amazon MP3 — $9\.49](http://amzn.to/2ajCE3h)), it is set by the publisher, unfortunately. Know that the music is available elsewhere for free.

 Attention is the only currency we have in life. If you take the time to listen to this music, I want you to know how much it means to me — thank you.
