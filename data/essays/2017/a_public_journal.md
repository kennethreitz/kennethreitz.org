# A (Public) Journal

    ![](http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/665498111876725f7613f1e6/1719666466302-7Q2U11ZDWXNF0WG3WHHN/162ef-956ca-image-asset.jpeg)![]()   I recently decided to build a small [Flask app](https://github.com/kennethreitz/journal) this weekend to serve a new purpose — sharing a public journal with the internet.

 Blog posts aren't the right place for some more candid content, so this new portion of my website exists to share some of my inner thoughts and feelings about the world. If you read it, please enjoy!

 Some of my favorite entries so far:

 * [Competition and Open Source](https://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/competition)
* [A Good Hat](https://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/my-hat)
* [Writing Reasonable Documentation](https://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/documentation)

 I plan to post to this journal quite often — I hope others find it insightful or useful!
