I recently returned from a trip to one of my favorite European cities â€” Dublin. ![view](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/10359139473_9ec8654474_b.jpg)

Dublin is a casual but picturesque city, filled with a cultured people of candor.

The infrastructure of the city is a bit chaotic. Unlike most major European cities, Dublin wasn't bombed and rebuilt after WWII.

The narrow, uneven roads are more authentic than the organized and systematic city grids of most modern metropolises. Apparently there used to be a fairly significant gang problem in the area I was staying in. But now, it's a creative hub, filled with artists, musicians, programmers, and the like.

The sun sets so late, but it rises so late as well. The weather has been fairly warm lately (40s-50s F) and the rain, believe it or not, has been *very* minimal, which is unusual for this time of year.

Dublin isn't a tourist town. You can find them there, but it's definitely not designed for them. It's a city that gets business done, rather creatively, I might add.
