# Having Stepchildren
*January 2024*





Is hard.

## House Rules

Because I'm not their biological parent, I have to be extra careful about how I interact with them. Having
house rules helps me to do that.

We're instituting some rules to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable.

1. Ask before playing games online.
2. Ask before using the tablet.
3. Ask before turning on the TV.
4. Say "yes sir" and "yes ma'am" to grown-ups.
5. Be polite and don't talk back.

Wish us luck!
