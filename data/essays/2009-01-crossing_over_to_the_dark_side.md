# Crossing Over to the Dark Side

  Well, I've done it. I've crossed over. To .NET.I will continue to be a complete open\-source junkie of course, butduring the work hours, I will no longer be working with PHP and Python.I will now be working with .NET and SharePoint.

 I was presented with a rather good reason for this actually:

 "Using SharePoint gives our clients a tremendous amount of security –they can trust that if, for whatever reason, something were to happen tous, their software could still be serviced by someone else." That'scertainly justifiable and understandable. That's a pretty good ideaactually. I like it.

<span class="sidenote">This reasoning highlights the tension between technological idealism and business pragmatism. The concern for client continuity and reduced vendor lock-in paradoxically led to adopting Microsoft's ecosystem—a reminder that business decisions often prioritize different values than technical decisions.</span>

 After looking into ASP.NET, I was actually quite surprised. The code isa lot cleaner than PHP. It looks rather powerful actually.

<span class="sidenote">The willingness to acknowledge technical merit across ideological boundaries demonstrates intellectual honesty. This openness to evaluating tools based on their actual capabilities rather than their ecosystem allegiances would remain a consistent theme in Kenneth's approach to technology.</span>

 Anyway, that's why I've crossed over. No hard feelings :)
