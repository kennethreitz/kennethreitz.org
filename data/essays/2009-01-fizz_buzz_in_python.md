# Fizz Buzz in Python

  Jeff Atwood of [Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com) has developed a sure fire test to filter out *good programmers* from *bad ones*. It's called  [the FizzBuzz test](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html), and it's a very simple problem to solve.<label for="sn-fizzbuzz-test" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-fizzbuzz-test" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">FizzBuzz became legendary in programming interviews because it revealed a shocking truth: many candidates who claimed programming experience couldn't write even the simplest code. The test exposes basic gaps in understanding loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic.</span> Enjoy!If you'd like to learn more about programming, [contact me](/about) for a one\-on\-one lesson.

  for i in range(1,101\):if not i % 15:print "FizzBuzz"elif not i % 3:print "Fizz"elif not i % 5:print "Buzz"else:print i<label for="sn-python-solution" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-python-solution" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This solution demonstrates Python's elegance through its concise syntax. Note the clever use of `i % 15` firstâ€”since 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5, this catches multiples of both without nested conditions.</span>
