# The Truth of Facebook's FriendFeed Aquisition
*January 2009*





  As I'm sure most of you know, [Facebook](http://facebook.com) decided today that it was going to buy [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/kennethreitz). [^1]

 My opinion might be a little biased... I just discovered FF [recently](http://kennethreitz.com/blog/friendfeed-is-awesome/), and I must say that I've been thoroughly impressed with the service so far. I've been spending an increasing amount of time on it every day, and It's most certainly a breath of fresh air from the clogged mob\-congestion of Twitter. [^2]

  So apparently someone at Facebook realized this and decided to join forces.

 So what is Facebook after? Absorbing the competition? I don't think so. Did you know FriendFeed is operated by only 11 people? and it rocks! That's definitely 11 people who are extremely talented and know exactly what they are doing. Something Facebook needs. [^3] They have been trying to put something together that works as well as FF for while now. The two merging might not be that bad, as long as FF marches on. My last favorite social site, [Pownce](http://pownce.com), was shut down when [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com) purchased them for the creation of [Motion](http://www.movabletype.com/motion/) â€“ an utter failure. [^4]

 **UPDATE**:

 Luckily, the two companies announced today that FriendFeed will continue to remain a separate, fully functional entity from Facebook. Facebook will be integrating features of FriendFeed. Good news! Lets see if it happens. [^5]

[^1]: The Facebook-FriendFeed acquisition in August 2009 was a significant moment in social media history. FriendFeed, founded by former Google employees, had pioneered real-time social aggregation and would influence Facebook's News Feed development significantly.

[^2]: This comparison between FriendFeed and Twitter captures the different approaches to social media in 2009. FriendFeed focused on aggregating content from multiple sources and fostering deeper discussions, while Twitter was becoming increasingly crowded and noisy as it scaled rapidly.

[^3]: The emphasis on FriendFeed's small team size (11 people) reflects the early startup culture of doing more with less. This was a classic "acqui-hire" - Facebook buying the company primarily for the talent, particularly Paul Buchheit (Gmail creator) and Bret Taylor, who would become Facebook's CTO.

[^4]: The Pownce reference provides important context about acquisition risks. Pownce was a Twitter competitor that Six Apart acquired and then shut down to create Motion, which failed. This pattern of promising acquisitions that then kill innovative services was already a concern in 2009.

[^5]: This optimistic update proved partially accurate - FriendFeed did continue operating for several more years, but Facebook gradually integrated its innovations (like real-time updates, Like button) into its main platform. FriendFeed was eventually shut down in 2015, following the typical acquisition pattern despite initial promises.
