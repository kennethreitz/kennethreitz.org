# My Standard CSS Attributes

<aside class="sidenote">
<strong>CSS Methodology Evolution:</strong> This post represents the pre-framework era of CSS development, when developers maintained personal utility libraries and standard attribute sets. Before CSS frameworks like Bootstrap (2011) and utility-first frameworks like Tailwind (2017), sharing and systematizing CSS approaches was much more ad-hoc and personal. The GitHub Gist reference shows early community-driven knowledge sharing.

  This is my minimal set of CSS Attributes that I use on nearly every project I work on.If you have any improvement suggestions, feel free to share.
