# Mint.com: Money Management 2.0

  There are a few things in life that I am naturally not good at. Some people fail at communication skills, while others [get angry and lash out at others for no reason](http://jwhsband.tripod.com/). I, however, like to spend all of my money. ALL of it. Every paycheck.

 But thanks to this lovely website, that is going to stop now: [mint.com](http://www.mint.com).

 Mint is an online budgeting and expense tracking system, which links to your bank account, credit cards, investments, and loan agencies. It's truly amazing what a little web 2\.0 site like that can do to change things around for you. I'm now saving my money and actually following a budget! Whenever I go over budget in a certain category, Mint notifies me immediately (via text message or email) of the indescrepency. And best of all, It shows me a pretty flow\-chart of what I spend all my money on! Data presentation is such a powerful tool.

 I spend $53 a month on McDonalds? I had no idea!

 So, come on! Go to [Mint.com](http://www.mint.com)! Give it a try! You might save a few bucks (or, like me, a few pounds!).
