# The Seasonality of Programming
*August 2025*

Every few years, the programming world discovers fire again.

Ruby on Rails would make web development effortless. Node.js would unify frontend and backend. React would make UIs predictable. Docker would solve deployment. Kubernetes would orchestrate everything. Now it's AI that will write our code for us.

Each time, we get excited about the new framework that will finally solve state management. The database that will revolutionize how we store data. The architecture pattern that will make our code maintainable forever.

Then, quietly, we discover the same problems that plagued the last solution. Performance issues. Complexity creep. Vendor lock-in. The learning curve that seemed manageable becomes a mountain. The community fragments. Enthusiasm wanes.

By then, the next fire has been discovered.

## The Eternal Return of Solutions

Most problems we're solving in programming have been solved before. Multiple times, in multiple ways, across multiple decades. Enterprise software has been handling user authentication, data persistence, concurrent processing, and distributed systems since before many of us were born.

The solutions weren't glamorous. They were written in Java or C# or COBOL. They ran on application servers with names like WebSphere and WebLogic. They used patterns like Model-View-Controller and Service-Oriented Architecture. Built by people in suits. People who went home at 5 PM and didn't tweet about their code.

But they worked. They processed billions of transactions, handled millions of users, and kept critical systems running for years without significant outages. The techniques they used—connection pooling, caching strategies, load balancing, graceful degradation—weren't revolutionary. They were just competent engineering applied consistently over time.

## Why We Keep Reinventing

The seasonality of programming isn't accidental. It serves psychological and economic needs that have little to do with technical necessity.

**Novelty bias** makes new solutions seem more attractive than existing ones, regardless of merit. We assume newer means better. That the latest framework learned from all previous mistakes. The psychological reward of learning something new beats the mundane satisfaction of mastering something old<label for="sn-dopamine" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-dopamine" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The tech industry's addiction to novelty mirrors social media's dopamine feedback loops—both optimize for engagement over depth, creating cycles of shallow learning and constant searching for the next hit.</span>.

**Career anxiety** drives adoption of trending technologies. Résumés with React and Kubernetes get more callbacks than ones with jQuery and monoliths, even when the latter might be more appropriate. We learn new tools not because they solve problems better, but because they signal that we're keeping up.

**Venture capital** funds the hype cycles that drive technology seasons. Investment flows toward companies promising to revolutionize established categories—"the Uber of X," "the blockchain-based Y." These companies need to justify their valuations by convincing developers that existing solutions are fundamentally inadequate.

**Conference economics** depend on having new content to present. You can't give the same talk about database normalization for ten years, even if database normalization remains important. The conference circuit needs fresh ideas, revolutionary approaches, paradigm shifts to sell tickets and maintain relevance.

None of this is inherently malicious. But it creates systemic pressure to treat proven solutions as obsolete and experimental technologies as mature.

## The Hidden Costs of Seasonal Programming

What looks like innovation from inside the tech industry often looks like chaos from outside it. While we chase the latest architectural patterns and deployment strategies, we lose sight of the [human costs](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) of our optimization choices.

### Technical Debt as Social Debt

Every rewrite, every migration to the new framework, every adoption of the revolutionary database creates work that doesn't directly serve users. The months spent moving from Angular to React to Vue could have been spent improving accessibility. Fixing performance issues. Adding features users actually requested.

This technical churn becomes social debt when products become less reliable, more complex, or harder to maintain because teams are constantly rebuilding foundations instead of improving the house. The instability we create in our codebases creates instability in the products people depend on.

### Complexity as Barrier

Each new layer of technological sophistication raises the barrier for participation. The simple LAMP stack that enabled millions of people to build their first websites? Gone. Replaced by containerized microservices architectures that require specialist knowledge to operate.

This complexity doesn't just affect developers—it affects the businesses, nonprofits, and communities that depend on software but can't afford cutting-edge engineering talent. The seasonal pursuit of technical elegance creates digital divides that exclude those without resources to keep up<label for="sn-digital-divide" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-digital-divide" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The same complexity that excites Silicon Valley engineers makes technology less accessible to small businesses, community organizations, and developing regions that could benefit most from digital tools.</span>.

### The Optimization Mismatch

Most critically, we optimize for metrics that matter to us—developer experience, deployment velocity, architectural purity—while remaining largely unaware of how these choices affect the people who use our software.

[The algorithm eats virtue](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) because we optimize for engagement over well-being. [It consumes democratic discourse](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_democracy) because we optimize for growth over social cohesion. [It fragments reality](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_reality) because we optimize for personalization over shared understanding.

The seasonal nature of programming amplifies this mismatch. By constantly chasing new tools and techniques, we avoid reckoning with the consequences of how we've been building software. The next framework will fix everything, so we don't need to examine whether our current approach serves human flourishing.

## The Taco Bell Alternative

Ted Dziuba captured this perfectly in his essay on ["Taco Bell Programming"](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html): every item on the Taco Bell menu is just a different configuration of roughly eight ingredients. With this simple periodic table of meat and produce, the company pulled down $1.9 billion.

The same principle applies to software. You can achieve most desired functionality with clever reconfigurations of basic Unix tools. Need to download millions of web pages? The cool-kids answer is a distributed crawler in some trendy language running on the cloud. The Taco Bell answer? `xargs` and `wget`. Need to process those pages? Skip Hadoop—just use `find crawl_dir/ -type f -print0 | xargs -n1 -0 -P32 ./process` for 32 concurrent processes with zero bullshit to manage.

Every time you introduce new code or third-party services, you're introducing failure points. Dziuba trusts `xargs` more than Hadoop. Hell, he trusts `xargs` more than himself to write multithreaded processors. This isn't just about technical elegance—it's about keeping your pager quiet at night.

## The Enterprise Wisdom

Enterprise software gets mocked for being boring, slow to change, risk-averse. But enterprise engineers often have constraints that force better long-term thinking: they maintain systems for decades, support thousands of users, meet regulatory requirements, work with limited budgets.

These constraints create different priorities. Enterprise developers care more about reliability than novelty, maintainability than elegance, gradual evolution than revolutionary change. They use technologies that are proven, documented, supported by vendors who will be around in ten years.

The results aren't always pretty by startup standards. But they work better for people who depend on them. Enterprise software fails less dramatically, scales more predictably, integrates more reliably with existing systems. It prioritizes boring reliability over exciting innovation.

## Sustainable Programming Seasons

The seasonality of programming isn't inherently harmful—technology does advance, new tools do solve real problems, and intellectual curiosity drives important innovation. The issue is when seasonal change becomes compulsive change, when novelty becomes the primary value.

Sustainable programming seasons would look different:

- **Longer cycles.** Instead of adopting new frameworks every year, we might evaluate them every three to five years. Give time to understand their real-world performance and community stability.

- **Problem-first adoption.** New technologies would be evaluated based on specific problems they solve rather than their general appeal or industry buzz.

- **Total cost accounting.** Technology decisions would consider not just development velocity but maintenance burden, security implications, talent availability, and migration costs.

- **User impact assessment.** We'd ask how technology choices affect the people who use our software, not just the people who build it.

- **Institutional memory.** Teams would maintain knowledge of why previous technologies were chosen and what problems they solved, avoiding the cycle of rediscovering old solutions.

## Beyond the Hype Cycle

The most important software often comes from people who step outside the seasonal programming cycle entirely. They use whatever technology solves their problem effectively, regardless of fashion. They focus on user needs rather than industry trends. They build for longevity. Not demo day.

[Early adoption](/essays/2009-01-early_adoption) can be valuable when it serves genuine innovation. But most seasonal programming isn't early adoption—it's middle adoption, following trends rather than setting them, optimizing for peer approval rather than user value.

The alternative isn't technological conservatism. It's technological intentionality. Choosing tools based on problems rather than popularity. Measuring success by impact rather than adoption metrics. Building software that serves human needs rather than industry expectations.

## The Responsibility of Seasons

Programming seasonality will continue as long as human psychology remains unchanged. We'll always be drawn to new solutions, excited by fresh approaches, motivated by the promise that this time will be different.

The question is whether we can develop awareness of these patterns and their consequences. Whether we can balance our appetite for innovation with responsibility for the systems we build and maintain.

Whether we can remember that software is ultimately a tool for serving human needs, not satisfying technical curiosity.

The seasons will change. The question is what we choose to plant, and what we're willing to harvest.
