# The Seasonality of Programming
*August 2025*

Every few years, the programming world discovers fire again.

Rails was going to make web development effortless. Node.js would finally unify frontend and backend. React would make UIs predictable (this time for real). Docker would solve deployment hell. Kubernetes would orchestrate everything beautifully. Now it's AI that will write our code for us.

Each time, we get genuinely excited. This framework will finally solve state management! This database will revolutionize how we store data! This architecture pattern will make our code maintainable forever!

Then reality hits. Performance issues crop up. Complexity creeps in. Vendor lock-in appears. That manageable learning curve? It's actually a mountain. The community starts arguing. Enthusiasm dies.

By then, the next fire has been discovered.

## The Eternal Return of Solutions

Most problems we're solving in programming have been solved before. Multiple times, in multiple ways, across multiple decades. Enterprise software has been handling user authentication, data persistence, concurrent processing, and distributed systems since before many of us were born.

The solutions weren't glamorous. They were written in Java or C# or COBOL. They ran on application servers with names like WebSphere and WebLogic. They used patterns like Model-View-Controller and Service-Oriented Architecture. Built by people in suits. People who went home at 5 PM and didn't tweet about their code.

But they worked. They processed billions of transactions, handled millions of users, and kept critical systems running for years without significant outages. The techniques they used—connection pooling, caching strategies, load balancing, graceful degradation—weren't revolutionary. They were just competent engineering applied consistently over time.

## Why We Keep Reinventing

This cycle isn't accidental. It serves psychological and economic needs that have nothing to do with actually solving problems.

**We're addicted to novelty.** New solutions always look better than existing ones, regardless of whether they actually are. We assume newer means better. That this framework learned from all previous mistakes. The dopamine hit of learning something shiny beats the boring satisfaction of mastering something that works<label for="sn-dopamine" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-dopamine" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The tech industry's addiction to novelty mirrors social media's dopamine feedback loops—both optimize for engagement over depth, creating cycles of shallow learning and constant searching for the next hit.</span>.

**We're terrified of being left behind.** Résumés with React and Kubernetes get callbacks. Résumés with jQuery and monoliths get ignored, even when those technologies would be better for the job. We learn new tools not because they solve problems better, but because they prove we're not dinosaurs.

**VCs fund the hype.** Money flows to companies promising to "revolutionize" boring, working solutions. "We're the Uber of databases!" "Blockchain-powered email!" These companies need to justify their valuations by convincing everyone that perfectly good existing tools are garbage.

**Conferences need content.** You can't give the same talk about database normalization for ten years, even though database normalization is still important and most people still don't understand it. The conference circuit needs "fresh" ideas and "revolutionary" approaches to sell tickets.

Nobody's trying to be evil here. But the result is that we treat battle-tested solutions as obsolete and half-baked experiments as production-ready.

## The Hidden Costs of Seasonal Programming

What looks like innovation from inside the tech industry often looks like chaos from outside it. While we chase the latest architectural patterns and deployment strategies, we lose sight of the [human costs](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) of our optimization choices.

### Technical Debt as Social Debt

Every rewrite creates work that doesn't help users. The months we spent migrating from Angular to React to Vue? That could have been spent making the site faster. More accessible. Adding features people actually asked for.

This churn becomes social debt. Products get buggier and more complex because we're constantly rebuilding foundations instead of fixing the roof. The instability we create in our code becomes instability in the things people depend on.

### Complexity as Barrier

Each new layer of technological sophistication raises the barrier for participation. The simple LAMP stack that enabled millions of people to build their first websites? Gone. Replaced by containerized microservices architectures that require specialist knowledge to operate.

This complexity doesn't just affect developers—it affects the businesses, nonprofits, and communities that depend on software but can't afford cutting-edge engineering talent. The seasonal pursuit of technical elegance creates digital divides that exclude those without resources to keep up<label for="sn-digital-divide" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-digital-divide" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The same complexity that excites Silicon Valley engineers makes technology less accessible to small businesses, community organizations, and developing regions that could benefit most from digital tools.</span>.

### The Optimization Mismatch

Most critically, we optimize for metrics that matter to us—developer experience, deployment velocity, architectural purity—while remaining largely unaware of how these choices affect the people who use our software.

[The algorithm eats virtue](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) because we optimize for engagement over well-being. [It consumes democratic discourse](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_democracy) because we optimize for growth over social cohesion. [It fragments reality](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_reality) because we optimize for personalization over shared understanding.

The seasonal nature of programming amplifies this mismatch. By constantly chasing new tools and techniques, we avoid reckoning with the consequences of how we've been building software. The next framework will fix everything, so we don't need to examine whether our current approach serves human flourishing.

## The Taco Bell Alternative

Ted Dziuba captured this perfectly in his essay on ["Taco Bell Programming"](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html): every item on the Taco Bell menu is just a different configuration of roughly eight ingredients. With this simple periodic table of meat and produce, the company pulled down $1.9 billion.

The same principle applies to software. You can achieve most desired functionality with clever reconfigurations of basic Unix tools. Need to download millions of web pages? The cool-kids answer is a distributed crawler in some trendy language running on the cloud. The Taco Bell answer? `xargs` and `wget`. Need to process those pages? Skip Hadoop—just use `find crawl_dir/ -type f -print0 | xargs -n1 -0 -P32 ./process` for 32 concurrent processes with zero bullshit to manage.

Every time you introduce new code or third-party services, you're introducing failure points. Dziuba trusts `xargs` more than Hadoop. Hell, he trusts `xargs` more than himself to write multithreaded processors. This isn't just about technical elegance—it's about keeping your pager quiet at night.

## The Enterprise Wisdom

Enterprise software gets mocked for being boring, slow to change, risk-averse. But enterprise engineers often have constraints that force better long-term thinking: they maintain systems for decades, support thousands of users, meet regulatory requirements, work with limited budgets.

These constraints create different priorities. Enterprise developers care more about reliability than novelty, maintainability than elegance, gradual evolution than revolutionary change. They use technologies that are proven, documented, supported by vendors who will be around in ten years.

The results aren't always pretty by startup standards. But they work better for people who depend on them. Enterprise software fails less dramatically, scales more predictably, integrates more reliably with existing systems. It prioritizes boring reliability over exciting innovation.

## Sustainable Programming Seasons

The seasonality of programming isn't inherently harmful—technology does advance, new tools do solve real problems, and intellectual curiosity drives important innovation. The issue is when seasonal change becomes compulsive change, when novelty becomes the primary value.

Sustainable programming seasons would look different:

- **Longer cycles.** Instead of adopting new frameworks every year, we might evaluate them every three to five years. Give time to understand their real-world performance and community stability.

- **Problem-first adoption.** New technologies would be evaluated based on specific problems they solve rather than their general appeal or industry buzz.

- **Total cost accounting.** Technology decisions would consider not just development velocity but maintenance burden, security implications, talent availability, and migration costs.

- **User impact assessment.** We'd ask how technology choices affect the people who use our software, not just the people who build it.

- **Institutional memory.** Teams would maintain knowledge of why previous technologies were chosen and what problems they solved, avoiding the cycle of rediscovering old solutions.

## Beyond the Hype Cycle

The most important software often comes from people who step outside the seasonal programming cycle entirely. They use whatever technology solves their problem effectively, regardless of fashion. They focus on user needs rather than industry trends. They build for longevity. Not demo day.

[Early adoption](/essays/2009-01-early_adoption) can be valuable when it serves genuine innovation. But most seasonal programming isn't early adoption—it's middle adoption, following trends rather than setting them, optimizing for peer approval rather than user value.

The alternative isn't technological conservatism. It's technological intentionality. Choosing tools based on problems rather than popularity. Measuring success by impact rather than adoption metrics. Building software that serves human needs rather than industry expectations.

## The Responsibility of Seasons

Programming seasonality will continue as long as human psychology remains unchanged. We'll always be drawn to new solutions, excited by fresh approaches, motivated by the promise that this time will be different.

The question is whether we can develop awareness of these patterns and their consequences. Whether we can balance our appetite for innovation with responsibility for the systems we build and maintain.

Whether we can remember that software is ultimately a tool for serving human needs, not satisfying technical curiosity.

The seasons will change. The question is what we choose to plant, and what we're willing to harvest.
