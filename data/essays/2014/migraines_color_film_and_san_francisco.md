# Migraines, Color Film, and San Francisco

I seem to have found myself with a newfound appreciation for color. I've been subtly adding more color to my wardrobe, buying brighter colored flowers for around the home, and I even purchased a brightly colored doormat to greet myself every time I come home. Of course, this raises some interesting questions about my photography. I shoot black and white exclusively with a camera that does the same. Should I re\-broaden my horizons?

 I was, of course, quite tempted to go out and buy a [Fujifilm X100S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ATM1MVA?tag=bookforkind-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&adid=1DE096V5Z8VDMYYYP0Y7&). Instead, I decided to start experimenting with color film emulsions with my beloved 1954 Double Stroke Leica M3 (discussed in my [Leica interview](http://blog.leica-camera.com/photographers/interviews/kenneth-reitz-exploring-the-material-world-in-an-electronic-universe/)). I had already been experimenting with some B\&W emulsions and home development, so the transition was relatively seamless and pragmatic.

 I find film to be such an incredible technology. Want to start experimenting with a completely new type of photography? Just pop a new roll in.

 ## Migraine Aura: Reds

 On November 2nd, 2013, I developed a fairly normal migraine. I took some Excedrin, per usual, and waited for it to pass. I won't go into details, but it didn't pass — I still have the exact same migraine today. It's a very rare headache syndrome called NDPH — [New Daily Persistent Headaches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_daily_persistent_headache). Luckily, I have some wonderful medication that keeps me quite functional most of the time by opening up the blood vessels in my brain.

 Much to my surprise, when the medication is temporarily able to fully lift this persistent headache, I find that the visible spectrum of reds are more intense to me. It's as if the migraine's aura has put a dampener on that color channel in my psyche. As a side effect, I now love taking colors of vivid reds.

 The photo above was taken the first day I was able to walk after developing this debilitating headache. I had waited all year for this tree's leaves to turn red. It was the most beautiful and intense red I have ever seen in my life.

 ## Traveling with the Leica M3

 After getting comfortable with the M3's manual exposure in my hometown, I decided to take it with me on a trip. San Francisco's streets, filled with color, seemed like a perfect place to try it out.

 While traveling, I pack as absolutely light as possible — a single backpack and a messenger bag, no matter how long the trip — so the decision to bring something as redundant as a second camera was not an easy one. However, the results couldn't have been more rewarding. The photos aren't the best I've ever taken (by far), but they are quite personal.

 There's something beautiful about capturing such beauty with a mechanical device.

 Having deprived my photographic eye from color for so long has definitely given me a newfound sensitivity to the color spectrum.

 ## Monochrom

 Monochrom is still my primary form. Color is just a new horizon.
