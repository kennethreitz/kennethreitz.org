# Google Docs Now Supports All Filetypes

  For an extra $5 a month, \[Evernote](http://evernote.com) lets you upload a file of any extension to their servers. This is a fantastic feature for developers who like to keep their random psd and 3ds files in sync with the cloud.Looks like Google finally took the hint. Within the next few weeks, they will be rolling out (in the typical staggered unveiling) the ability to upload up to 1 GB of files to Google Docs. 

 Additional storage space will be $0\.25 / GB / Year. That's one tenth the price of Amazon S3!
