# Baconfile: Awesome Public S3 Bucket Frontend

Amazon S3 is a fantastic data storage platform â€” I use it for everything.

 It's perfect for sharing data with friends. The only disadvantage is the interface: there is none. You can manage your buckets files with REST requests, along with a number of desktop clients. That's fine, but what about your visitors? The only way to show them what you have to offer is to build a frontend system that ties into the API.


### The Solution

 **Baconfile**: Simple S3 Frontend. You'll never be happier.
