# New Years Resolutions for Startups

  Here's a small list of 2009 *New Year's Resolutions* for your startup.

  ### 1. Simplify

 Anyone can make something complex. It takes thoughtful planning, consideration, and discipline to make something simple. Simple \= elegant. The same applies to your business.

 ### 2. Get some Humility

 Don't assume you know what your audience wants. [Find out first](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/13/how-to-create-a-global-phenomenon-for-less-than\10000/).

 ### 3. Release a Real Product

 10,000 great ideas are worthless if you never act upon them. Pick one. Pick three and mix. Release.

 ### 4. The Opposite is Also True

 Your product can be enormously successful for a single feature. Someone else's product will be even more successful for excluding that same feature.

 ### 5. Loose the Bulk

 Startups \[don't need much](http://cdixon.tumblr.com/post/311546950/things\-startups\-do\-and\-dont\-need). The more you spend, the less you earn. Keep things small. Keep things simple. You'll thrive.
