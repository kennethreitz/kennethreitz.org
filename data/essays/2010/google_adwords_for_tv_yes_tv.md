# Google AdWords for TV. Yes, TV.

  Today, Google unveiled their latest technology: \[AdWords for TV](http://www.google.com/adwords/tvads/index\-b.html) and \[AdSense for TV](https://www.google.com/adsense/www/en\_US/tv/).This totally blows my mind. They are about to totally revolutionize the television industry.

 You can manage TV ads just like you manage AdWords ads for the web. You enter the amount you're willing to pay per impression, and your daily budget, and Google does the rest. 

 Google is the future of all advertizing. NBC, be afraid. 

 From Google:
