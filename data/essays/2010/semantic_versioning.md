# Semantic Versioning

  While listening to this week's episode of \[The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com), I came across Tom Preston\-Werner's \[Semantic Versioning Specification](http://semver.org/). I love what I found.For many years, the open source community has been plagued with version number dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from project to project, they are practically meaningless.

 This specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your next project. Included is a helpful guideline for correlating repository tagging. 

 In good taste, Mojombo also opened up the website. If you'd like to contribute to the site, just fork the repository, make your changes, and send a pull request.The way it should be.
