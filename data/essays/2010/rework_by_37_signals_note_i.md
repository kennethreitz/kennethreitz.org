# Rework by 37 Signals » Note I

  As I read through 37Signals' *Rework*, I'll give small, sporadic commentary.\> There's a new reality. Today anyone can be in business. Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible. Technology that cost thousands is now just a few bucks or even free. One person can do the job of two or three or, in some cases, an entire department. Stuff that was impossible a few years ago is simple today.

 It's true.

 Within seconds I can stand up 45 servers with 64GB of RAM, a custom\-built operating system, and distribute them all over the world for mere dollars a day. 

 There's no excuse now.
