# Terminal Productivity App: AutoJump

  On average, I'd say I spend 65% of the workday in a terminal session. About 95% of that time is within the same same 4 directories. \`cd foo\` \& \`cd bar\` can get old.\*\*AutoJump\*\* is a "cd command that learns". It tracks shell history to detect which directories you spend the most time in, and allows you to \*jump\* to them without any directory context. It even supports Zsh tab completion. :)

 From this:

  \`cd /Users/kreitz/repos/public/gistapi\`

 To this:

  \`j gistapi\`

 Life is good.
