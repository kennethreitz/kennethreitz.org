# Contact Syncing for Massive Productivity Booster

  Google significantly increased my quality of life recently. How? Let me explain.

 While I am a firm believer that cloud computing should *never* be viewed as a replacement for the current desktop/ model, I must say that I am now a **huge** fan of storing my data on the internet. Not all of my data, keep in mind, but information that needs to be accessed by multiple computers, of course – but that goes without saying.

 I have always had the problem of not being able to keep track of all my data. I switch computers and operating systems so often, I can't keep track of my contacts at all. And when I update one, I have to go through and update many different databases – not the most efficient method.

 So, the ultimate solution is – obviously – to consolidate all of my contacts into one database. I used to keep all of my contacts on my Samsung Blackjack cellphone. This worked well, since I could easily sync it with a computer. This caused a problem, however: I could only sync it with one system. If I was at work or on another system, I had no way to get to my friend's email addresses.

 Last month, Google Contacts started to support Exchange Syncing, which happens to work *flawlessly* with my Windows Mobile 6\.1 install.

 My life will never be the same. Thank you, Google. I am eternally grateful.

 More details soon!
