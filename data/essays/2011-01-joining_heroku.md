# Joining Heroku!

  I am extremely happy to announce that I am joining the [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) team!If you aren't familiar, Heroku is a Polyglot Platform as a Service for hosting web applications. The product is executed so well that they are responsible for an entire micro\-industry of PaaS platforms for different languages (Python included). Company after company strives to become the "Heroku for *x*".

 Until recently, there were only a few [good options](http://ep.io/) for modern Python deployment. However, a few months ago, Heroku added [official Python support](http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/) to the Cedar stack — it is *beautiful*.

 ### The Role

 I will be responsible for the technical design of Heroku's Python offering, as well as Heroku’s voice in the Python community.

 Other responsibilities will include:

 * Contributing to open source projects.
* Driving best practices adoption.
* Be passionate about the general success of Python.

 Best. Job. Ever.

 ### Arc90 \+ Readability?

 Arc90 \+ Readability and myself have parted ways on excellent terms. Leaving the team was a very difficult decision to make. Readability is a hard\-working team of incredible individuals, working passionately on one of my favorite online tools.

 Readability is very much in a "move as fast as possible" stage of growth. Unfortunately, my passions for workflow automation, best\-practices, and autonomy proved to mix harshly with the style of Readability's operation.

 We're very proud of what we [built over the past six months](http://blog.readability.com/2011/11/reading-needs-a-platform-introducing-the-new-readability/), and I look forward to seeing the platform grow.

 ### Heroku's Values

 I've always found myself attracted to beautiful and elegant architectures and APIs. Heroku is a natural perfect fit. They're inspiring as both a Product, a Platform, and a Company—embodying the values that would later crystallize into [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice). Here are a few selections of team marketing:

 On craft:

 
> "Heroku is a do\-ocracy. Makers of every stripe are welcomed here. Amazing ideas and execution are rewarded with independence and trust."

 On productivity:

 
> "From customer facing roles to our developers, we believe in building, not meeting."

 Lastly, my personal favorite:

 
> "We spend as long as it takes to make things right."

 Needless to say, I'm tremendously excited about becoming an official Herokai™.
