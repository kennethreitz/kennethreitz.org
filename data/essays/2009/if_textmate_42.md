# if (TextMate == 42)

  **{**I've had some pretty extensive experience using every major OS for various forms of development and end\-user work. And just like every other programmer in the world, I certainly have my opinions, likes, and dislikes of every platform (some are a lot closer to perfection than others of course). Text editors are the same way. Everyone loves one or two, and hates all the others.

 There are others of course: I actually know a guy who edits his live "enterprise\-level php applications" with Pico. And he says he has been for 10 years (Note that Pico has only been out for 9 years). What a joke.

 
> Pico is not a programmer's tool.

 But anyway: For literally decades, there has been a great war between unix developers. [VI(m) vs. Emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war "Explantion of Editor War").

 I am most certainly a proponent of VI, and probably always will be. It's a fantastic editor, and it suits my needs pefectly. And for those of us who need something a little more streamlines there's always [CREAM](http://cream.sourceforge.net/ "CREAM Texteditor Homepage"), which is a fantastic implementation of a heavily customized GVIM that can handle literally anything you throw at it with little or no fuss.

 Now all software, in any context, is a tool. Nothing more. VI and EMACS and all others exist for one reason: to make a programmer's life easier. That's why they were invented, and that's why they are maintained.

 Now, I still use VIM all the time in my day\-to\-day life. Its wonderful to SSH into just about any \*nix server on the planet, and have VIM sitting there, waiting for me to tell it what to do. It helps me to feel at home. I used to use it full\-time for all of my coding on my workstations as well. I was passionate about it. I'd tote VIM all the time. VIM is great. It seemed so. It used to.

 ![](http://media.kennethreitz.com/images/textmate-logo.png)Used to. And then there was TextMate. TextMate. TextMate. Have a mac? [Try it](http://download-b.macromates.com/TextMate_1.5.8.dmg). Now. [Download it](http://download-b.macromates.com/TextMate_1.5.8.dmg). [Buy it](http://license.macromates.com/). Pirate it, I don't care. **Your life will never be the same.**

 TextMate is seriously the best piece of software I have come across in a very very long time. I can code incredibly fast with it. It helps me to become a better programmer. We all agree that you should NEVER Copy and Paste code: but using code snippets is different. It's like... An experience I cannot describe.

 I'll be purchasing a new laptop soon, and to be honest with you, the fact that I'll have TextMate on a mac makes me sure without a doubt to get an Apple computer. That and the fact that Mac OS X is a FANTASTIC operating system)

 
> TextMate is a text editor like no other.

 There's nothing better. And there never will. I know that's quite an extreme statement, but it's true. I'll do a full review eventually. I'm just so blown away. Sorry for my thoughts being all over the place in this post. I can't think strait. [Textmate](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate Product Page").
