# uNetBootin: The Utility Belt for OS's

  If you're in the mood to try a new operating system or two, I highly reccommend you try this little utility: uNetBootin. It is an image downloader that lets you easily select which Linux distro you'd like to install and it instantly starts fetching it from the cloud for you. Once the download is complete, it will allow you to put that bootable image on a jump\-drive for super easy and quick installs.
