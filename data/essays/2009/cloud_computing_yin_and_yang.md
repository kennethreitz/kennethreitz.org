# Cloud Computing: Yin and Yang

  Cloud computing enables us. Amazon's EC2 allows anyone in the world to have instant access to incredibly powerful high\-end servers that would usually cost tens of thousands of dollars for pennies on the dollar.\#\#Life is good.

 Of course, people use this technology for both good and bad. In fact, a few days ago, someone wrote a tutorial for [Cracking PGP with an Amazon EC2 instance \& EDPR](http://news.electricalchemy.net/2009/10/cracking-passwords-in-cloud.html). Again, life is good.

 **Remember:** if you create an successful open door web service, all people, good and bad, will come.
