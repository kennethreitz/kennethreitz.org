# Aesthetics: More Than Meets the Eye

  I was doing some routine poking around the [TextMate Wiki](http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/HomePage) tonight, and I came across an [amazing mod](http://jason-evers.com/code/code-like-i-do). Amazing. After installing it, my favorite editor looked brand new, and I started hacking away at code for hours.

 Customized (yet clean) interfaces really help me focus on my work. Working in an IDE with a black background just feels right to me. I wasn't nearly as satisfied with my .NET development when using the default [Visual Studio color scheme](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/06/Join-the-Dark-Side-of-Visual-Studio.aspx). I found the dark and everything became better. I felt more at home. I looked at it and it made me smile.

 Just a thought.
