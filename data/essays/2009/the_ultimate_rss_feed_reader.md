# The Ultimate RSS Feed Reader

  What would the ultimate RSS Reader have? Hmmm....**Features:**

 * Easy\-to\-manage import/export
* Available anywhere and in a variety of formats
* Easy access to both urls and inline\-viewing abilities
* Customizable fonts
* Takes up less than 200 MB of RAM (this rules out all Adobe Air Applications)
* Auto feed sniffing from urls
* The ability to play podcasts and other media that is thrown at it (unlike the PSP)
* Syncing for offline viewing
* Expendable

 *Closest contender*: **Google Reader**! It offers all of this functionality and more. It makes my world a better place to live.
