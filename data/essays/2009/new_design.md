# New Design!

  KennethReitz.com now has a new, rich theme, ready to take on a new life. And now iPhone friendly! My gloal? To become more well known that both [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com) and [Chris Parillo](http://chris.parillo.com). Nothing wrong with them, of course. I'm just as qualified though. And I think I might bring more to the table. Think I can do it?

 I built the site with PHP on top of Wordpress with a hint of Coreylib and jQuery. A nice mix, if you ask me. I ditched [DISQUS](http://disqus.com/) in favor of IntenseDebate (as you can see below). DISQUS has a terrible media server that fails constantly. I can't stand that. [IntenseDebate](http://intensedebate.com) comes pre\-themed too, and, I must say, it looks *nice*.

 The design was inspired by [haveamint.com](http://haveamint.com). They did a phenomenal job and I wanted to take what they had and build from it.Expect this to be update much more frequently. Hopefully daily.
