# Django Remote Development Server

  ![](http://media.kennethreitz.com/images/django-logo.png) If you've worked with Django much at all, I'm sure you've had this problem: wanting to access the built\-in development webserver remotely. Typically, this integrated mini\-server ignores all requests from any IP Address other than 127\.0\.0\.1 . If you run the following command, however, it will be accessible remotely. VERY useful for remote dev work.


```
manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
 Enjoy!
