# Back to What I Really Love

  A couple of months ago, I took a position at a company that tailors Microsoft SharePoint solutions.The business model was very strong (and successful), the work was challenging, and there was lots of opportunity.

 At the end of the day though, I just couldn't get past one thing: Microsoft and.NET. This is not stuff that I wanted to spend the rest of my life.

 The company offered very generous compensation for Microsoft Certification â€“ but what good does that do me?

 I could do it, but it would only be for the money. I love working with software of all kinds, but the development I was doing did not sharpen my skills in any way.

 So, I decided that the longer I stayed, the more I would simply be delaying my leaving. So another opportunity came up, and I decided to take it. I am now a developer working with PHP, Symfony, Java, Groovy, Grails, Apache, and more. The list grows every day.

 Now life is good. It's never been better in fact.
