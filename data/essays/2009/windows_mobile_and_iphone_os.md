# Windows Mobile and iPhone OS

  I've owned about 5 WIndows Mobile devices, 3 Palm Devices, and 1 iPhone.

 What we all need:

 * Simplicity
* Power
* Reliability
* Speed
* Integration

 **Palm OS** (Pre\-Pre haha):

 * Simple. Very Simple.
* Does what it needs to do and doesn't falter.
* Not much in terms of applications.
* Most certainly not designed for a mobile professional.
* It's a glorified rolodex.

 **Windows Mobile** (5, 6, 6\.1\):

 * Attempts to satisfy someone who needs to read spreadsheets on the go.
* Very slow and unstable. Not good for phone use. At all.
* Integration is sub\-par.
* Lots of work\-arounds for lots of things, nothing is simple.
* Fonts are ugly.
* Interface is clunky.

 **iPhone OS**:

 * Smooth, and very nice looking.
* Font rendering is exceptional.
* Web browsing is a dream.
* Did I mention how good it looks?
* Fantastic applications, integration, and standards.
* Apps need approval (good and bad).
* Very fast. Very slick. Problem free.

 **Verdict**:

 iPhone OS simply cannot be beat. It's perfect. I haven't used Android, but it's more of a platform than an intended out\-of\-the\-box Mobile OS. You aren't intended to use the built\-in Window Manager if you don't want to. Windows Mobile: pay attention.
