# Facebook Lite Open to Public!

   It's official, [Facebook Lite](http://lite.facebook.com) was opened up to the US public about 10 minutes ago.

 This slimmed down version of Facebook is wonderful for those of us on slow internet connections (or tethering from our iPhones), this is a dream come true.

 Reminds me of the good ol' days, when I had to go to http://gmu.facebook.com to see my facebook friends.

  Here you can see it in action:
