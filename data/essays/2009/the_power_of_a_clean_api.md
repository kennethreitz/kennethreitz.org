# The Power of a Clean API

  The folks over at [Mozilla Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/) never cease to amaze me with their unique ideas. They strive to transform the way users interact with the web forever.

 [**Mozilla JetPack**](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/) is a bit different, though. This tool allows web developers to make incredibly powerful Firefox Extentions with the layout languages they already know and love.

 My god, this is amazing.
