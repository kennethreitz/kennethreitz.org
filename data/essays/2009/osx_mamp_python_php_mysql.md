# OSX + MAMP + Python + PHP + MySQL

   If you're a web developer who uses MAMP in conjunction with anything other than PHP,   
I'm sure you've had quite a large bit of frustration involving multiple MyQL instances.

 Not any more! This simple chain of commands will save you days upon days of troubles:

  $ sudo rm /tmp/mysql.sock$ sudo ln \-s /Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock /tmp/mysql.sock

 I only wish I had found this sooner.

  Enjoy.
