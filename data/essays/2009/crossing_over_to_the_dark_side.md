# Crossing Over to the Dark Side

  Well, I've done it. I've crossed over. To .NET.I will continue to be a complete open\-source junkie of course, butduring the work hours, I will no longer be working with PHP and Python.I will now be working with .NET and SharePoint.

 I was presented with a rather good reason for this actually:

 "Using SharePoint gives our clients a tremendous amount of security â€“they can trust that if, for whatever reason, something were to happen tous, their software could still be serviced by someone else." That'scertainly justifiable and understandable. That's a pretty good ideaactually. I like it.

 After looking into ASP.NET, I was actually quite surprised. The code isa lot cleaner than PHP. It looks rather powerful actually.

 Anyway, that's why I've crossed over. No hard feelings :)
