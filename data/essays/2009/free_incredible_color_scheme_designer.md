# Free Incredible Color Scheme Designer

  ![Picture 3.png](http://www.programmerfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/color-wheel.png)Being the programmers that we are, design isn't always listed as one of our stronger abilities. Every programmer should have a sense of design, however. Otherwise, every application you would ever use would be far less useful and be much less appealing. *Aesthetics are everything*.

 ColorSchemeDesigner allows any user to create breathtaking Color Schemes for any purpose in it's quick and easy\-to\-use interface. It allows you to use the color wheel to make precisely correct schemes. Options include: monochrome, complimentary, traids, tetrads, analogical, and accented analogical schemes. All are fully customizable and mathematically correct.The site even allows you take your color scheme and test it out on a test page for web design. You can do anything from sharing the exact scheme to your friends, to downloading it as a Photoshop of Gimp Color Scheme, XML, or plaintext file. **It even will allow you to download your ColorScheme as HTML / CSS !** What a time saver!

 Other services (like Adobe's [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com/)), aren't nearly this functional, and do not offer nearly as many features to its users. The best thing of all is it's *free*.

 Give [ColorSchemeDesigner](http://colorschemedesigner.com "Amazing Color Scheme Designer!") a try!
