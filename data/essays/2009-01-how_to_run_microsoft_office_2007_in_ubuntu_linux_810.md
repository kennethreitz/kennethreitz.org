# How to Run Microsoft Office 2007 in Ubuntu Linux 8.10
*January 2009*





  ![ms-office-2007](http://www.programmerfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/msoffice2007.gif) Wouldn't it be lovely to have a nice, clean installation of Microsoft's Office 2007 Suite to run on your Ubuntu Linux Distribution? For some people, this is the only thing that truly holds them back from an all\-Linux environment... But not anymore! We have compiled a nice, concise set of instructions to help guide you along. ### Install Wine:

 WINE (**W**ine **I**s **N**ot an **E**mulator) is an application layer for Linux that interprets the Windows API and DLLs into native Linux commands. This allows for programs made for Windows to be run in Linux!In order to run Office 2007, Wine 1\.1\.9 (or newer) is **required.** It is currently in a development release. If you donâ€™t have it installed already (this is very likely), go ahead and type the following commands, which will set it up for you:


```
wget -q http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```

```
sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/intrepid.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list
```

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install wine cabextract
```
 **NOTE**: *On non\-Debian based systems, this will not work. Please refer to* [*this site*](http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb "WineHQ Installation Procudures") *for installation instructions.*

 You should now have an installation of Wine 1\.1\.9 installed on your system. To confirm the version of Wine installed, type the following:


```
wine --version
```
 ### Install winetricks:

 [Winetricks](http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks "Winetricks Page") is a small SH script which will go on the internet and automatically fetch and install Microsoft DLLs and Libraries into Wine with almost no hassle at all! To download it directly, type the following commands:


```
wget http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks
```

```
chmod +x winetricks
```
 ### Utilize winetricks:

 This will setup all necessary libraries and DLLs that Office 2007 will need to run properly:


```
winetricks gdiplus riched20 riched30 msxml3 msxml4 msxml6 corefonts tahoma vb6run vcrun6 msi2
```
 Please be patient while the downloads complete. This script is working hard and is saving hours of your time.

 ### Insert Office 2007 Disk and Run Setup!

 Now that we have all of the DLLs necessary to run the Installer, let us do so!


```
wine pathToCD/setup.exe
```
 From here on out, you should be good to go! The installer should run and install everything just as if it was a Windows system!

 If you have any problems, ask, and we'll try to help you out as much as possible!

> **2025 Note**: This tutorial represents the classic Linux migration challenge of 2009 - running Windows software on Linux through Wine compatibility layers. The detailed Wine setup process reflects how complex cross-platform compatibility was before cloud-based Office alternatives became mainstream. The mention of Office 2007 as "the only thing holding people back from all-Linux environments" captures a pivotal moment when desktop software dependencies still anchored users to specific operating systems. Today's SaaS-first world has largely eliminated these compatibility barriers, making this tutorial a historical artifact of the desktop software era.
