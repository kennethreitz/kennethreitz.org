# So, I Bought a Surface Book
*January 2017*





  So, I decided to buy myself a Surface Book today. It's a surprisingly high quality device that easily competes with my MacBook Pro in terms of build and design.

 I decided to buy it for a number of reasons:

 * I've been a little bit depressed lately, and new toys always help me get out of a funk.
* There are a plethora of games available for Windows.
* I enjoy the challenge of setting up a proper development environment on this platform.

The new [Unix Subsystem for Windows 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) is surprisingly enjoyable, and was able to produce a build of Python 2\.7\.13 without any problems.Â 

 So far, I'd say there's only a 25% chance that I'll return the device. Fingers crossed!
