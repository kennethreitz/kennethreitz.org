# Test-Driving a $200 Coding Font: Operator Mono
*January 2016*

 ## Which Typeface to Use?

 I've invested a lot of time in optimizing my development environment and workspace — and typefaces are a large part of that. 

 Over the years, I've cascaded through a number of monospaced typefaces for coding, including— Monaco, MS Consalas, Inconsolas, Inconsolata-dz, and Ubuntu Mono.

 [Ubuntu Mono](http://font.ubuntu.com) was my favorite monospaced typeface, used longer than any other, until I started using Operator Mono about six months ago.

 The *Hoefler & Co.* type foundry released [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) around this time—a very thoughtfully handcrafted typeface inspired by the pica-ruled days of typewriters. It is beautiful, and I have found it to be a pleasure to use.

 ## Operator Mono for Programming

 I find that different typefaces (as well as [color schemes](/essays/sublime-text-2-love)) both set the mood for my development environment, as well as offer utility in the way that I parse programmable text. 

 While using *Operator Mono*, I found that I scan entire words as I read code more easily; while in other typefaces, my parsing style is often more letter-by-letter. 

 This observation could be written off as a subjective one, but I am all about the subjective, above all else — especially when it comes to my environments. 

 ## Feature: Italics in Script

 The most unique feature of this font is that it includes an italicized typeface that uses *monospaced* script characters.

 While perhaps appearing novel at first, I have found that using this (beautiful) script typeface for code comments has improved both the quality of tone and frequency of my code annotations — something which I highly value. 

 ## Is it worth it?

 That's totally up to you.

 This is a designer typeface from the most influential and prestigious type foundry in the world. Much like an [Hermès Edition Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-hermes/silver-stainless-steel-feu-single-tour?preSelect=false&product=MNQ22LL/A&step=detail#), it is an entirely unnecessary expense that may bring great subjective joy to your life.

 To me, that's all that really matters—part of understanding [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice) where the tools and environment we choose shape our consciousness and creative expression.

 ## Bonus Integration Quirks

 * Terminal.app (my favorite console) does not support italics. [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com), however, does.
* Figuring out the [italics escape codes for zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/kennethreitz.zsh-theme) was a fun adventure.
