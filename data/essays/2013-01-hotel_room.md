The hotel room becomes a metaphor for temporary spaces of possibility, reflecting the nomadic lifestyle often associated with the tech industry.</span>

This concept of temporary disconnection would later influence Kenneth's thinking about healthy boundaries between humans and technology.</span> A place to reflect.
