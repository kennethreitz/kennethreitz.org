<span class="sidenote">This essay captures a pivotal moment in tech history—Apple's 2009 earnings represented the convergence of the iPhone's momentum and the early App Store ecosystem, fundamentally changing how we think about mobile platforms and developer relationships.</span>.  
 But, Why? Because they have proven that thoughtful design and attention to every minute detail will always win in the end<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's emphasis on "thoughtful design" reflects his core philosophy that would later influence his approach to Python library design—prioritizing developer experience and elegant APIs over feature complexity.</span>. 

 Because they have shown that designing with both developers and users equally in mind is essential<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">This insight about dual-audience design would prove prophetic—Apple's success came from treating developers as first-class citizens while maintaining exceptional end-user experiences, a balance Kenneth would later apply to his open-source work.</span>. 

 Because they noticed that being remarkable isn't about being the go\-to guy all the time.

 Because they realized that it's okay to do not have the biggest market share. 

 Because they realized there is a balance. And they found it. 

 Because they make the best laptops around.

 Because they lead a tribe of people<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">The concept of "leading a tribe" reflects Seth Godin's influence on early tech culture—Apple didn't just sell products but created a movement, much like Kenneth would later do with the Python community through his libraries and advocacy.</span>.

 So, Congratulations Apple.

 You deserve it.

 Really.
