# Snowpocalypse

  Snow, snow, snow, snow. I've never been so tired of the word. 

 My small town of Winchester, VA suffered from over 3 feet of snow over the past week. Everything shutdown.

 I am reminded importance of infrastructure. 

 I lived in Minnesota for 5 years, and have never seen so much panic from some simple snow. They have the infrastructure in place there. They can handle the snow. Winchester was totally unprepared for it. It's amazing.
