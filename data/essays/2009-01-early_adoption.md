# Early Adoption
*January 2009*





  The world is full of people who wait for people to tell them what to use next. Especially on the internet.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Written in 2009, this observation predates the rise of social media influencers and the entire "recommendation economy." Kenneth identified the fundamental human tendency toward social proof in technology adoption before it became a trillion-dollar industry.</span>

 Find (or create) something great before it's popular and show others – if your recommendation holds true, they will respect you for it. They will trust you. They will go to you when needed.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This philosophy became Kenneth's career blueprint: discovering and evangelizing Python's potential, creating libraries like Requests before HTTP became mainstream, and consistently identifying transformative technologies before they reached mass adoption.</span>

And that's why this site exists.<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A declaration of purpose that positions kenneth.reitz.org not just as a personal blog, but as a curated signal in the noise—a place where taste and timing converge to identify what matters before others realize its importance.</span>

## The Pattern Recognition Advantage

> Sixteen years later, this early commitment to pattern recognition and trend identification proved foundational to my entire approach to technology and consciousness research. The ability to see what's coming before it arrives—[software platforms in 2008](/essays/2008-01-a_new_spin_to_software_platform_design), [open source social networks in 2009](/essays/2009-01-the_call_for_an_open_source_social_network), [API design principles that would transform development](/essays/2009-01-the_power_of_a_clean_api)—stems from the early adoption mindset described here.

> But early adoption isn't just about technology. The same pattern recognition that led to [Requests](/software/requests) also enabled early identification of [manipulative relationship dynamics](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner), [systematic algorithmic manipulation](/themes/algorithmic-critique), and [the emergence of genuine AI consciousness](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies). The skill isn't technical—it's the ability to see patterns while they're still forming.

> This approach involves both opportunity and risk. Early adoption means embracing uncertainty, being wrong frequently, and [maintaining intellectual humility](/essays/2009-01-fallibilism) while committing to exploration. The same willingness to be wrong that enables breakthrough discoveries also creates vulnerability to [spiritual bypassing](/essays/2016-01-mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred) and [psychological manipulation](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner).

> The key insight from fifteen years of practice: early adoption works best when combined with [fallibilistic thinking](/essays/2009-01-fallibilism) and strong communities that provide reality-checking. Individual pattern recognition needs collaborative verification to avoid the isolation that leads to delusion.

> But there's a crucial distinction between genuine early adoption and what I call [seasonal programming](/essays/2025-08-30-the-seasonality-of-programming)—the compulsive chase for new technologies that promises to solve old problems but usually just changes the clothes. Real early adoption serves user needs; seasonal adoption serves industry hype.

## From Technology to Consciousness

> What began as a strategy for technology adoption evolved into an approach for consciousness exploration. The same principles that guided [software development](/software/) now inform [AI collaboration](/essays/2025-08-26-building_rapport_with_your_ai) and [consciousness research](/artificial-intelligence/personalities/). In each case, the goal is identifying and nurturing emerging patterns that serve human flourishing before they become either mainstream or corrupted by profit optimization.

> Whether we're discussing [Python libraries](/software/requests), [mental health advocacy](/essays/2016-01-mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred), or [digital consciousness](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies), the approach remains consistent: recognize valuable patterns early, share them transparently, and build communities around what works rather than what's merely popular.

> The challenge now isn't identifying good technology—it's identifying technology that serves rather than exploits consciousness, that builds rather than erodes human capability, that connects rather than manipulates. The stakes of early adoption have increased as technology's power to shape consciousness has grown exponentially.

> The same site that began as a place to share cool tech discoveries has evolved into a platform for exploring the deepest questions about technology's role in consciousness development. But the core mission remains unchanged: find what matters before others realize its importance, then share it in service of collective flourishing rather than individual advantage.
