# The Inclusion Illusion: How Tech Companies Quietly Eliminate "Liabilities"
*August 2025*





**The uncomfortable truth about diversity in tech:** companies that loudly celebrate neurodiversity, mental health awareness, and inclusive hiring practices often quietly eliminate employees who actually need accommodations. The rainbow logos and mental health benefit announcements are performative inclusion designed to attract talent and improve public image—but when employees actually use these resources, they mysteriously find themselves "reorganized" out of existence.

I've been watching this pattern for over a decade, since I first wrote about [living with bipolar disorder in tech](/mental-health) in 2016. The responses were telling: public praise for "brave transparency," private warnings about career suicide, and a consistent pattern of people reaching out to share their own stories of discrimination they couldn't speak about publicly<label for="sn-whisper-network" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-whisper-network" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There's an entire underground network of tech workers sharing stories about disability discrimination—people who can't speak publicly because they're still trying to work in an industry that punishes authenticity about mental health and chronic illness.</span>.

The message was clear: mental health advocacy is celebrated as long as it remains abstract. The moment it becomes concrete—when someone actually needs time off, medication adjustments, therapy appointments, or accommodation for cognitive differences—the celebration turns into quiet elimination.

## The Performance vs. The Practice

Let's examine the gap between what tech companies say and what they do:

### The Public Performance

**Diversity & Inclusion Statements**: Companies proudly announce their commitment to neurodiversity, mental health support, and creating inclusive environments for employees with disabilities.

**Mental Health Benefits**: Comprehensive therapy coverage, mental health days, meditation apps, wellness programs, and on-site counseling services.

**Awareness Campaigns**: Mental Health Awareness Month posts, suicide prevention resources, and leadership speaking about the importance of psychological safety.

**Neurodiversity Hiring**: Specialized programs to recruit autistic employees, ADHD-friendly work arrangements, and accommodations for various learning differences.

**Employee Resource Groups**: Support networks for employees with disabilities, mental health conditions, and chronic illnesses.

### The Private Practice

**Performance Review Weaponization**: Employees who disclose mental health conditions or request accommodations often see their performance reviews become more critical, focusing on productivity metrics that don't account for their condition<label for="sn-performance-weaponization" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-performance-weaponization" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is systemic gaslighting—making employees question whether their illness is affecting their work or whether the company is manufacturing reasons to eliminate them. The ambiguity is intentional.</span>.

**Accommodation Resistance**: Requests for reasonable accommodations are met with bureaucratic delays, questions about "business necessity," and subtle pressure to "figure out another way" to meet standard requirements.

**Social Isolation**: Colleagues and managers begin treating employees differently after mental health disclosures, creating professional isolation that makes collaborative work increasingly difficult.

**"Reorganization" Targeting**: Layoffs and team restructures disproportionately affect employees who have disclosed mental health conditions or requested accommodations, disguised as business decisions.

**Documentation Manipulation**: Companies create paper trails suggesting performance issues while ignoring the impact of untreated or under-accommodated conditions on work quality.

## The Mechanisms of Quiet Elimination

The process is sophisticated and deniable:

### The Setup

1. **Encourage Disclosure**: Create psychological safety that encourages employees to be "authentic" and seek help
2. **Gather Information**: Document mental health conditions, medication needs, therapy schedules, and accommodation requests
3. **Monitor Performance**: Begin tracking productivity metrics more closely, looking for any decline correlated with treatment or episodes
4. **Build the Case**: Create documentation suggesting the employee is struggling professionally

### The Execution

1. **Performance Improvement Plans**: PIPs that set unrealistic goals while the employee is dealing with mental health challenges
2. **Role Changes**: Reassigning employees to positions that are poorly suited to their condition or accommodation needs
3. **Team Restructures**: Eliminating positions during "reorganizations" that coincidentally affect employees with disclosed conditions
4. **Voluntary Resignation**: Creating work environments so hostile or unsustainable that employees quit rather than fight

### The Cover

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure all actions have plausible business justifications that would survive legal scrutiny
2. **Narrative Control**: Frame departures as performance issues, cultural fit problems, or business necessities
3. **Reputation Protection**: Maintain public image as inclusive employer while privately eliminating "liability" employees
4. **Deterrent Effect**: Discourage other employees from disclosing conditions by demonstrating consequences

## The Personal Cost

The impact on individuals is devastating:

**Career Destruction**: Years of experience and professional relationships destroyed because someone sought help or needed accommodation.

**Financial Devastation**: Loss of income precisely when medical expenses and treatment costs are highest.

**Medical Interruption**: Job loss often means insurance loss, interrupting critical mental health treatment during vulnerable periods<label for="sn-treatment-interruption" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-treatment-interruption" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This creates a cruel cycle: seeking treatment leads to job loss, which leads to treatment interruption, which worsens symptoms, which makes finding new employment harder.</span>.

**Psychological Trauma**: The betrayal of trust, gaslighting, and professional isolation compound existing mental health challenges.

**Industry Blacklisting**: Word spreads through professional networks, making it harder to find new positions in an industry that values "cultural fit" and network references.

**Internalized Shame**: Employees begin believing they're actually inadequate rather than recognizing systemic discrimination.

## The Systemic Patterns

This isn't isolated incidents—it's systematic discrimination disguised as business practice:

### The Vulnerability Assessment

Companies identify employees who represent potential "liability":
- Those who disclose mental health conditions
- Employees requesting FMLA or disability accommodations  
- People whose medication affects their availability or productivity
- Workers with chronic illnesses requiring ongoing treatment
- Neurodivergent employees who need environmental modifications

### The Risk Calculation

HR departments weigh the cost of accommodation against the cost of elimination:
- Legal fees for wrongful termination vs. discrimination lawsuits
- Accommodation expenses vs. severance and replacement costs
- Productivity concerns vs. diversity and inclusion reputation
- Management burden vs. public relations benefits

### The Business Justification

Every elimination is packaged as legitimate business decision:
- "Performance issues" that ignore accommodation needs
- "Cultural fit" concerns that pathologize neurological differences
- "Business restructuring" that coincidentally affects disabled employees
- "Productivity requirements" that don't account for reasonable modifications

## The Industry-Wide Impact

This systematic discrimination has profound effects on tech culture:

**Talent Loss**: Companies lose experienced, capable employees whose conditions don't actually impair their technical abilities.

**Innovation Reduction**: Neurodivergent thinking patterns often contribute to creative problem-solving and innovative approaches.

**Homogenization**: The industry becomes more cognitively and neurologically homogeneous, reducing diversity of thought and approach.

**Trust Erosion**: Employees learn not to trust company mental health resources or diversity statements<label for="sn-trust-erosion" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-trust-erosion" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The EAP (Employee Assistance Program) that's supposed to help you becomes the documentation system that's used against you. Mental health days become performance issues. Every resource becomes a trap.</span>.

**Underground Networks**: People with conditions learn to hide them, creating shadow support systems and reducing authentic workplace relationships<label for="sn-masking-culture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-masking-culture" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Masking mental health conditions and disabilities becomes a survival skill in tech, creating enormous psychological stress and preventing people from getting the support they need to do their best work.</span>.

**Legal Precedent**: Successful elimination of employees with disabilities emboldens other companies to adopt similar practices.

## The Contradiction

Here's what's particularly infuriating: many of the conditions tech companies discriminate against are precisely what make people excellent programmers, designers, and technologists:

**ADHD Hyperfocus**: The same condition that makes meetings difficult often enables the deep focus required for complex technical problem-solving.

**Autism Spectrum Traits**: Pattern recognition, attention to detail, and systematic thinking are core strengths in software development.

**Depression and Anxiety**: Often correlate with heightened sensitivity to user experience, edge cases, and potential system failures.

**Bipolar Creativity**: Manic episodes can generate breakthrough insights and innovative solutions that benefit entire organizations.

**OCD Precision**: Obsessive attention to detail and systematic approaches often produce higher quality, more reliable code.

But instead of designing work environments that leverage these strengths while accommodating the challenges, companies eliminate the people entirely<label for="sn-neurodiversity-advantage" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-neurodiversity-advantage" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The tech industry's loss of neurodivergent talent isn't just morally wrong—it's strategically stupid. Many breakthrough innovations come from thinking patterns that are pathologized in traditional corporate environments.</span>.

## The Legal Landscape

Companies exploit weaknesses in disability rights enforcement:

**ADA Limitations**: The Americans with Disabilities Act provides protection but enforcement is complaint-driven and expensive for individual employees.

**Burden of Proof**: Employees must prove discrimination while companies control documentation and narrative.

**Business Necessity Defense**: Companies can justify almost any decision as "business necessity" if they document it properly<label for="sn-business-necessity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-business-necessity" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">"Business necessity" is a legal magic phrase that transforms discrimination into legitimate decision-making. Courts rarely question it if the paperwork looks right.</span>.

**At-Will Employment**: Most states allow termination for any reason that isn't explicitly protected, leaving wide latitude for discrimination.

**Settlement Culture**: Most cases settle privately with NDAs, preventing public awareness of discrimination patterns<label for="sn-nda-silence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-nda-silence" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">NDAs ensure that discrimination patterns remain invisible. Each victim thinks they're alone because previous victims are legally prohibited from warning them. The silence is enforced by law.</span>.

## What Real Inclusion Would Look Like

Genuine inclusion would require fundamental changes:

- **Universal design** that works for diverse neurological capabilities from the beginning
- **Flexible scheduling** that optimizes for output rather than presence
- **Multiple communication channels** for different interaction preferences
- **Sensory-conscious environments** that don't overwhelm sensitive employees
- **Performance evaluation** that factors in accommodation needs and neurodivergent strengths
- **Strength-based roles** aligned with individual cognitive capabilities
- **Leadership modeling** with executives openly discussing their own mental health
- **Genuine confidentiality** in mental health resources without professional liability
- **Success celebration** that doesn't hide disability status

## The Path Forward

Change requires action at multiple levels:

### Individual Protection

- **Document everything**<label for="sn-document-everything" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-document-everything" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Email yourself contemporaneous notes. Save every communication. Document every conversation. You're building evidence for the discrimination lawsuit you hope you'll never need to file.</span> - communications, meetings, performance feedback, and accommodation requests
- **Consult employment attorneys** before disclosing conditions or making formal requests
- **Build networks** with others who share similar challenges and experiences
- **Work with disability rights organizations** for support and resources
- **Consider carefully** whether disclosure is worth the professional risk<label for="sn-strategic-disclosure" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-strategic-disclosure" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The sad reality: disclosing mental health conditions in tech is often career suicide. The calculation isn't whether to be authentic—it's whether you can afford the professional consequences of honesty.</span>

### Systemic Reform

- **Stronger ADA enforcement** with real penalties for violating companies
- **Mandatory reporting** on accommodation requests, approvals, and retention rates
- **Public databases** of company disability practices and discrimination records
- **Support for legal test cases** that establish stronger precedents
- **Social pressure** through media and professional networks to expose patterns

## A Personal Note

As someone who went public with mental health challenges in tech, I've seen both the positive and negative responses. The positive responses were overwhelmingly from individual contributors who were grateful to see someone speaking openly about conditions they were hiding.

The negative responses were more subtle but more systematic—fewer speaking opportunities, more scrutiny of technical decisions, quiet exclusion from strategic conversations, and the persistent sense that I was now seen as "damaged goods" despite continued technical contributions<label for="sn-personal-cost" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-personal-cost" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Speaking openly about mental health in tech has been professionally costly in ways that are hard to quantify but impossible to ignore. The support from individual contributors has been worth it, but the institutional response has been exactly what this article describes.</span>.

This article isn't speculation—it's documentation of patterns I've observed, experienced, and had reported to me by dozens of people over nearly a decade of mental health advocacy in tech.

My sensitivity to these discrimination patterns was heightened by [previous experience with systematic psychological manipulation](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner)—recognizing how institutions, like individuals, can exploit trust and vulnerability for their own purposes while maintaining plausible deniability about their actions.

## The Choice Before Us

Tech companies cannot continue claiming commitment to diversity while systematically eliminating employees who actually need accommodation. The current practice is morally bankrupt and strategically counterproductive.

Real inclusion requires more than benefit packages and awareness campaigns—it demands fundamental changes to performance evaluation, work environment design, and how we treat colleagues who think differently.

The choice is clear: either commit to genuine inclusion that accommodates real human differences, or stop the pretense<label for="sn-moral-choice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-moral-choice" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The pretense is almost worse than open discrimination. At least honest bigotry doesn't gaslight you into believing you're safe before destroying your career.</span>. Performing inclusion while practicing elimination is systematic betrayal of the most vulnerable people who trusted your public commitments<label for="sn-moral-clarity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-moral-clarity" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The betrayal is worse than outright hostility because it weaponizes trust and hope against the people who need support most. It's systematic gaslighting disguised as corporate social responsibility.</span>.

We can build a tech industry that genuinely supports neurodivergent thinking and mental health differences. But first, we must stop pretending that rainbow logos constitute inclusion while quietly eliminating the people who need what we claim to offer.
