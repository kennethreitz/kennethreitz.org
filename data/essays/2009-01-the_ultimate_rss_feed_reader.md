# The Ultimate RSS Feed Reader
*January 2009*





  What would the ultimate RSS Reader have? Hmmm....**Features:**

 * Easy\-to\-manage import/export
* Available anywhere and in a variety of formats
* Easy access to both urls and inline\-viewing abilities
* Customizable fonts
* Takes up less than 200 MB of RAM (this rules out all Adobe Air Applications)<label for="sn-memory-constraints" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-memory-constraints" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This 2009 perspective on memory usage seems quaint todayâ€”modern browsers routinely use gigabytes of RAM. The concern about Adobe Air applications reflects the era's resource-conscious development mindset before abundant RAM became commonplace.</span>
* Auto feed sniffing from urls
* The ability to play podcasts and other media that is thrown at it (unlike the PSP)
* Syncing for offline viewing
* Expendable

 *Closest contender*: **Google Reader**! It offers all of this functionality and more. It makes my world a better place to live.<label for="sn-google-reader" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-google-reader" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Google Reader's 2013 shutdown marked the end of an era for RSS consumption, fragmenting the RSS ecosystem and contributing to the rise of algorithmic social media feeds. This endorsement captures the service at its peak influence in web content aggregation.</span>
