  I absolutely love this watch — I picked up the black edition. You won’t see many reviews around (I couldn’t find *any* online, hence me writing this), because this piece is a brand new offering from Shinola.

 Shinola is a bit of a controversial brand in the watch world — you either love them or hate them. I happen to love them — They make beautifully designed timepieces, albeit at a high price point for not being automatics, and I love what they’re doing for the city of Detroit.

 [**The Canfield Sport**](https://www.shinola.com/mens/new-arrivals/the-canfield-sport-chrono-watch-45mm-89889.html) is the most complicated movement Shinola has introduced to it’s lineup yet — it features both a day of the week and current month indicator, as well a sweeping day–of–the–month indicator (the half–moon hand). In addition, it offers excellent chronograph functionality, with 1/10th of a second precision — all presented in an elegant and exquisitely designed face. I’m a fan.

 From Shinola's marketing:


> *Shinola is breaking the mold when it comes to the traditional sports watch. The Canfield Sport is a timepiece where complexity takes center stage. Built using a top loaded  construction, the Canfield Sport features a fixed  with ceramic insert and an open  punctuated with three sub dials, making this watch sporty and instinctively classic. The look is completed with a black leather strap. Every detail of the Canfield Sport makes it a refined and quintessential timepiece to add to your wardrobe.*

I’m quite surprised by how often I use the chronograph (multiple times, daily). I owned many digital Timex’s as a child with a stopwatch feature, but never utilized them nearly as often as I do the chronograph on this Canfield Sport.

 The thickness of the case, coming in at 13mm matches the size of the watch perfectly. I wouldn’t change a thing about it. Sure, they could have made it thinner, but they didn’t need to (unlike the Apple Watch).

 Adjusting the current month, day of the week, and day of the month each require a simple button press (each indicator has a dedicated button positioned around the case body, which advances the indication by one). Very simple and intuitive. 

 This piece is a bit pricey (I got it for approx. $720, discounted) for a quartz movement, albeit a fairly high quality one (Argonite 5040\.F) — it’s not thermo–compensated or anything fancy like that. But, it should be much more reliable than most automatic movements.
