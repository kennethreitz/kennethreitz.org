# Terminal Productivity App: AutoJump
*January 2010*





  On average, I'd say I spend 65% of the workday in a terminal session. About 95% of that time is within the same same 4 directories. \`cd foo\` \& \`cd bar\` can get old.\*\*AutoJump\*\* is a "cd command that learns"<label for="sn-learning-tools" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-learning-tools" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This essay captures Kenneth's early appreciation for developer productivity tools—a theme that would become central to his career. AutoJump represented a new class of "learning" command-line tools that emerged in the late 2000s, foreshadowing today's AI-assisted development environments. The specific statistics (65% terminal time, 95% in 4 directories) reveal the highly focused, repetitive nature of development work that drives the need for automation.</span>. It tracks shell history to detect which directories you spend the most time in, and allows you to \*jump\* to them without any directory context. It even supports Zsh tab completion. :)

 From this:

  \`cd /Users/kreitz/repos/public/gistapi\`

 To this:

This mirrors the broader evolution toward more natural interfaces that Kenneth would later explore in his work with AI systems.</span>

 Life is good.<label for="sn-life-good" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-life-good" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The casual "Life is good" conclusion became a signature element of Kenneth's early technical writing—expressing genuine delight in elegant solutions. This optimistic, tool-focused mindset would later influence his approach to API design and developer experience, prioritizing simplicity and joy in technical workflows.</span>
