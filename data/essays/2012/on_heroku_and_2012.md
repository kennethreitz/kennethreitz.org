# On Heroku and 2012

  Alas, 2012 is quickly coming to a close.This has been an absolutely incredible year — easily the best of the mere twenty\-four I've experienced so far. I became a member of the Python Software Foundation, traveled all over the world, met several thousand inspiring software developers, and collaborated on dozens of incredible projects.

 It's important to reflect; perspective is everything.

 ## Heroku

 I officially [joined Heroku](http://static.squarespace.com/static/533ad9bde4b098d084a846b1/533d64b0e4b05778b6aa60f8/533d65a3e4b05778b6aa74bb/1396532643996/joining-heroku.html?format=original) exactly one year ago today. It's amazing how time flies.

 Heroku is directly responsible for the majority of my satisfaction of the past year. I feel incredibly privileged to work with this fine group of individuals — the most talented, classy, supportive, attentive, and caring group of people I've ever had the pleasure to meet.

 Words can't serialize how much I recommend [working for Heroku](https://coderwall.com/team/heroku). If you are speaking at a conference, Heroku will fully fund your trip. If there's a natural disaster in your area (e.g. Super\-Storm Sandy), you will be contacted by a dedicated member of the Vibe team, ensuring your family's safety, accommodation, and well\-being.

 The strangest part of the Heroku environment is our unlimited vacation policy. My job consists primarily of two things: Making Heroku awesome for Python, and Making Python awesome for Heroku. I took a week off after a six\-week world tour last month, but kept finding myself doing what I love to do — my work.

 I'm looking forward to many more years with Heroku.

 ## Accomplishments \& Goals

 For years, I dreamed of being a well known member of the open source community. I spent hundreds of nights obsessing over other's code and developing my own development style and philosophies.

 Much to my surprise, all of that work really paid off. Today, I'm the [\#1](https://github.com/search?q=followers%3A%220+..+80000%22&p=1&ref=searchbar&type=Users&l=Python) most followed Python GitHub user and the [\#17](https://github.com/search?l=&p=2&q=followers%3A%220+..+80000%22&ref=searchbar&type=Users) most followed GitHub user in total. Requests has been downloaded [1,500,000\+](https://crate.io/packages/requests/) times and is indirectly helping [change the world](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/how-team-obamas-tech-efficiency-left-romney-it-in-dust/). OSX\-GCC\-Installer reached over 46 TB of downloads and [directly inspired](http://static.squarespace.com/static/533ad9bde4b098d084a846b1/533d64b0e4b05778b6aa60f8/533d65a4e4b05778b6aa74be/1396532644204/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html?format=original) Apple's Command\-Line Tools.

 It's humbling to look at those metrics, as vain as they are. Validating your work is important.

 ## Traveling the World

 I've spent the majority of my time this year traveling. It's a bit daunting to think about, honestly:

 One year ago, I had given only **one talk** in my entire life ([PyCodeConf](http://py.codeconf.com/)) and didn't even own a passport.

 This year alone:

 * 139,669 miles traveled by air
* 139 hotel nights.
* 29 talks given.
* 20 conferences attended.
* 11 meetups attended.
* 8 countries visited.

 I also rediscovered my deep love for Photography:

 And even got the chance to reconnect with friends from past lives:

 ## Lessons Learned

 I spent most of my life moving around the country. Between 8th and 10th grade, I attended **seven** different schools. Being out of my element is my element. I've learned a lot during my travels. You have lots of time to reflect and get to know yourself.

 Considering being a developer evangelist?

 * You'll get lonely.
* Personal time is essential. Relax and enjoy yourself.
* Window seats are awesome. Anyone who disagrees has no soul.
* Less is more. My travel kit has slowly shrunk to a single small backpack.
* You'll meet more people than you can imagine. You won't remember names. Just ask.
* Your influence and audience is much larger than you think. The majority of your users are unspoken. How often do you reach out to the author of a library you love?

 It's the best job on earth.

 ## Personal Values

 In closing, I'll leave a short list of my personal values. They haven't changed much over the years. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.

 * Life's not a race, but there's no speed limit either.
* Positivity. Negative atmospheres are toxic. Remove yourself from them.
* Fallibilism \& Open Mindedness. There is only one thing I can be certain of in life: that I am prone to error. Nothing saddens me more than someone who is unwilling to listen.
* Attention is your only currency. Allocate it sparingly. Don't spend a single moment in life doing something you don't want to do.

 Here's to 2013! Hopefully the Mayans based their calendar on the Twinkie.
