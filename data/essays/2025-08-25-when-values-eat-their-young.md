# When Values Eat Their Young: How Ideal-Driven Groups Drift into Their Own Shadow


**Picture this:** A Slack channel for an open-source project that prominently displays "Be excellent to each other" in its community guidelines. Six months later, a maintainer posts a thoughtful critique of a proposed code of conduct change. Within hours, they're called "toxic," told they're "literally causing harm," and face demands for their removal. The pile-on continues for days.

Nobody seems to notice the irony.

This isn't some made-up scenario. This is real shit that happens. I've watched it unfold in projects I love, in companies I've worked for, in communities I've believed in.<label for="sn-pattern" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-pattern" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">I've been in the Python community since 2008. I've seen us go from "be nice" to... something else. But this isn't just about tech. Watch any church split, any activist group implode, any company betray its founding principles. The pattern is universal.</span>

## The Paradox

The more a community cares about its values, the more vulnerable it becomes to betraying them. Not because the values are wrong. Not because the people are bad. But because human social dynamics create predictable failure modes that turn principles into their opposite.

> "Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket." — Eric Hoffer

Your community—whether it's an open source project, a startup, a church, a yoga studio, or an activist group—will face these pressures. The question is whether you'll build guardrails before you need them.

## The Machinery of Inversion

### Virtue Signaling: When Performance Replaces Practice

Virtue signaling gets a bad rap, often weaponized to dismiss legitimate moral concerns. But the phenomenon is real. In any community with strong values, there's social currency in being seen as embodying those values.

The problem? Performance gets rewarded more than practice.

Think about it like code coverage metrics. The goal is good: write tested, reliable code. But once coverage percentage becomes the metric that determines promotion, you get developers writing meaningless tests that check nothing but boost the numbers.<label for="sn-metrics" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-metrics" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">I've literally seen tests that assert `true === true` just to hit coverage targets. Goodhart's Law in action: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."</span> The measure became the target, and the target became meaningless.

In value-driven communities, this looks like competitive displays of ideological purity. Increasingly elaborate pronoun signatures. Lengthy self-flagellating acknowledgments that crowd out actual work.<label for="sn-land" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-land" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">When your project README is 90% virtue signaling and 10% documentation, you've lost the plot. Users need to know how to use your software, not your politics.</span>

The person who speaks most loudly about inclusion might be the same one privately blacklisting colleagues for minor infractions.

### Purity Spirals: The Revolution Eating Its Children

A purity spiral begins innocently: someone raises the bar for what counts as living up to the community's values. Others, not wanting to appear less committed, raise it further. Soon, you're in a bidding war where yesterday's progressive position is today's problematic stance.

Consider what happened in Extinction Rebellion splinter groups between 2019-2021: It started with "reduce your carbon footprint." Then "go vegan." Then "don't fly." Then "don't have children." Eventually, members were being shamed for taking jobs that required commutes. Multiple XR chapters hemorrhaged members, keeping only the most privileged who could afford such restrictions—ironically undermining their stated goal of building a mass movement.<label for="sn-purity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-purity" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This pattern was documented in Andreas Malm's "How to Blow Up a Pipeline" (2021) where he critiques the purity spirals within climate movements. The French Revolution parallel remains apt: the Jacobins who sent others to the guillotine eventually found themselves condemned by even purer revolutionaries (see Simon Schama's "Citizens").</span>

### The Iron Law of Institutions

Political journalist Jonathan Schwarz articulated this in his Iron Law of Institutions (2007):

> "The people who control institutions care first and foremost about their power within the institution rather than the power of the institution itself."

Watch what happens when a community leader's position depends on there being problems to solve. Suddenly, problems become very hard to solve. The Code of Conduct committee that needs violations to justify their existence. The working group that creates more working groups. The board member more interested in their board seat than the community itself.

You know what's fun? Watching these same leaders give keynotes about empathy while actively ignoring maintainer burnout in their own projects.

This isn't conscious villainy. It's structural incentive. When your position in a community depends on fighting dragons, you'll always find dragons to fight—or create them.<label for="sn-dragons" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-dragons" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This is why I'm skeptical when any group claims they need "permanent" positions to address "systemic" issues. If the issue is truly systemic, why would your job exist to solve it? The incentives are backwards from the start.</span>

### Goal Displacement: When the Means Become the Ends

Every organization starts with a mission. Over time, the processes created to achieve that mission become the mission itself: the meeting about the meeting, the committee to oversee the committee, the elaborate consensus process that ensures nothing ever gets decided.

One collective I observed spent six months perfecting their decision-making process. During those six months, they accomplished exactly zero of their actual goals.<label for="sn-process" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-process" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Process matters, but when your process for deciding how to help people takes longer than actually helping them would have taken, you've lost the plot. Ship something. Help someone. Then iterate.</span>

### Cognitive Dissonance: The Stories We Tell Ourselves

When behavior and beliefs conflict, something has to give. Usually, it's the beliefs that bend. A community that prides itself on kindness but regularly engages in cruel pile-ons doesn't admit hypocrisy. Instead, it develops elaborate justifications: "This isn't cruel, it's accountability." "We're not being exclusive, we're maintaining safety." "It's not censorship, it's consequences."

The human brain is exceptionally good at resolving dissonance through narrative. The problem is, these narratives become the water we swim in—invisible, unquestionable, and ultimately destructive to the very values they claim to protect.

## Case Studies in Contradiction

### The Inclusive Space That Wasn't

The Tech Workers Coalition, founded in 2014 with values of "radical inclusion" and worker solidarity, experienced multiple schisms over ideological purity. By 2020, several chapters had split over whether members could work at certain companies, whether to allow managers, and what constituted "real" tech work.<label for="sn-twc" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-twc" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Similar patterns documented in Logic Magazine's "Tech Worker Organizing" issue (2020) and in Wendy Liu's "Abolish Silicon Valley" (2020) where she discusses the contradictions within tech activism movements.</span>

A member asked, in good faith, about the practical implications of abolishing prisons for violent crime victims. They were immediately labeled as "perpetuating carceral violence," subjected to a days-long struggle session, and ultimately banned. The community's response to someone seeking education on their values was to exclude them for not already embodying those values perfectly.

The bitter irony: the banned member was a formerly incarcerated person trying to understand how abolition frameworks addressed their own complex experiences with violence.<label for="sn-irony" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-irony" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This one still makes me angry. The person with the most lived experience of the system being discussed was excluded for not already knowing the "correct" academic language to discuss it. That's not justice — it's gatekeeping by people who've never seen the inside of a cell but have strong opinions about those who have.</span>

### The Kind Open-Source Project

JavaScript framework communities have faced these patterns repeatedly. Communities that pride themselves on being welcoming—with comprehensive Codes of Conduct, community teams, and regular appreciation posts—still see maintainers harassed over technical decisions. 

The pattern is predictable: disagreement escalates, GitHub issues become battlegrounds, and when exhausted maintainers take mental health breaks, they're accused of "weaponizing mental health to avoid accountability."

Python, a language and community that prides itself on progressive values of inclusion and kindness, faced similar tensions during the "[walrus operator](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/)" debates of 2018-2019. Despite the community's "be nice to each other" ethos and extensive diversity initiatives, the discussion became so toxic that Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, stepped down as BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life). His resignation email (July 12, 2018) was devastating:

> "I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a PEP and find that so many people despise my decisions... I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL, and you all will be on your own... I'm tired, and need a very long break."

The kindness was performative. When tested by real conflict, the community defaulted to the same toxic behaviors they claimed to stand against, but wrapped in the language of justice and accountability.<label for="sn-kindness" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-kindness" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Multiple maintainers documented similar experiences. See Nolan Lawson's "What it feels like to be an open-source maintainer" (2017) and André Staltz's "Software below the poverty line" (2019). The same people who put mental health in their bios will destroy someone having a public breakdown.</span>


### Personal Experience

I experienced this firsthand. I worked for a search API company that proudly championed neurodiversity—it was all over their hiring materials, their company values. They knew about my schizoaffective disorder when they hired me. They said they valued different types of minds.

Then I had an actual episode. Made an embarrassing, disturbing comment on GitHub during a manic phase—clearly unwell, clearly delusional. Within 24 hours, I was fired. No discussion of accommodation. No recognition that this was literally the neurodivergence they claimed to value. Just gone.

Neurodiversity was a recruiting tool, not a real commitment.

### Beyond Tech

This isn't just a tech problem. I attended a church for years that preached about community, love, and spiritual growth over worldly success. Then they let the pastor go—officially because he "wasn't focused on growth enough." He'd been focusing on deepening relationships, helping struggling members, building real community. But the board wanted bigger numbers, more tithing, a permanent building.

The irony? A significant portion of the congregation left in response to his firing. The growth-obsessed board destroyed the actual growth they had. They prioritized metrics over mission and lost both.

Before you conclude that all value-driven communities are doomed to hypocrisy, let's acknowledge some crucial truths:

**These communities exist for good reasons.** The tech industry really does have inclusion problems. Open-source really can be hostile to newcomers. Traditional institutions really do perpetuate harm. The values these communities espouse aren't just nice-to-haves—they're attempting to address real, documented problems that cause real human suffering.

**Many communities succeed.** For every horror story, there are quiet success stories: communities that actually embody their values, resolve conflicts constructively, and create genuine change. These don't make headlines because "community functions as intended" isn't news.<label for="sn-success" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-success" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Some communities get it right. They recognize that mental health isn't a weapon or an excuse — it's a reality. They understand that "be kind" means being kind even when someone's struggling, not just when they're productive.</span>

**The alternative is worse.** Communities without stated values don't avoid these problems—they just make them invisible. At least a hypocritical community can be called out on its hypocrisy. A community that never claimed to care about inclusion can exclude with impunity.

**Structural forces are real.** Social media algorithms reward outrage. Venture capital demands growth over health. Academic incentives favor publication over practice. These aren't excuses, but they are context that explains why even well-intentioned communities struggle.

## The Anti-Drift Checklist (For Humans)

Here's your practical playbook for keeping your community from eating its young:

### Build in Healthy Conflict
- **Rotate devil's advocates**—make disagreement someone's actual job, not a personality trait
- **Ask "what would change our mind?"** before every major decision—if nothing would, you're already lost
- **Reward people who surface problems**—not just those who maintain harmony
- **Create structured dissent channels**—places where criticism is explicitly invited

### Make Values Measurable
- **Define what success looks like in behavior, not just outcomes**—"kindness" means responding to crisis with support, not pile-ons
- **Document your edge cases**—what do you do when someone is both victim and perpetrator?
- **Track who gets second chances**—and who doesn't (this will reveal your real values)
- **Measure who's leaving, not just who's joining**—exit interviews tell truth

### Prevent Purity Spirals
- **Explicitly value "good enough"**—perfectionism is the enemy of inclusion
- **Celebrate people who admit they were wrong**—make course correction high-status
- **Ban comparative suffering**—no "more oppressed than thou" competitions
- **Set maximum consequences**—if everything is a firing offense, nothing is

### Reality-Check Your Rhetoric
- **Compare your About page to your last three decisions**—do they match?
- **Ask newcomers what values they observe** (not what you claim)—fresh eyes see clearly
- **Check if your heroes would be welcome**—would your community's founders survive your current rules?
- **Review your greatest hits and worst moments**—which better represents who you really are?

### Design for Human Frailty
- **Build systems that assume people will have bad days**—including leadership
- **Create restoration paths, not just punishment**—how does someone come back from a mistake?
- **Acknowledge that hurt people hurt people**—trauma explains but doesn't excuse
- **Plan for mental health crises**—they will happen, especially in communities that attract vulnerable people

## Common Failure Modes

Watch how quickly noble values transform into their opposites when institutional pressures take hold:

| Stated Value | Common Failure Mode |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Inclusion | Exclusion of those who don't speak the "right" language |
| Kindness | Cruel enforcement of kindness norms |
| Safety | Using "safety" to shut down disagreement |
| Accountability | Accountability for thee but not for me |
| Consensus | Minority veto that creates paralysis |
| Transparency | Performative transparency that hides real decisions |
| Growth | Growth at the expense of founding principles |

## Re-aligning Means with Ends

The tragedy of values eating their young isn't that people are hypocrites. It's that good people with genuine commitments to important values can create systems that betray those values through entirely predictable social dynamics.

The solution isn't to abandon values or become cynical. It's to recognize these patterns as universal human tendencies and design systems that account for them. Just as we write tests because we know code will have bugs, we need to build guardrails because we know communities will drift.

> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design." — Friedrich Hayek

The same humility applies to designing communities. We can't perfect human nature, but we can create structures that fail gracefully, correct course, and keep the gap between stated values and lived reality as small as possible.

## Conclusion

Look.

I still believe in open source. I believe in communities built on values like kindness, inclusion, and collaboration. But good intentions aren't enough. You need systems. You need guardrails. You need to actually give a shit about people when they're at their worst, not just when they're shipping code.

Build the guardrails *before* you need them. Because once you've driven out the people who came to you for help—the ones who believed in your stated values, who were vulnerable enough to show their struggles—you can't un-eat them.

And they won't come back.

I didn't.
