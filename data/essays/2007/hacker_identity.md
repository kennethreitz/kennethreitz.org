# .::Hacker Identity::.

  I've recently come to identify myself with the hacker community. While I have always considered myself to be apart of this, I recently have become slightly more... enabled in certain areas.The typical Protestant work ethic is that is a "value emphasizing the necessity of constant labor in a person's calling as a sign of personal salvation." I must heavily disagree.

 The principles of the hacker ethic are:

 * Access to computers — and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works — should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands\-on Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust authority — promote decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

 I couldn't agree more...
