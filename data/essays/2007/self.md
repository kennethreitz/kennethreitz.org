# Self.

  Looked into your eyes  
and saw  
My guilty pride  
The tragic flaw  
The innocence  
I once embraced  
Has shown it’s hidden   
Ugly face

 Looked into your eyes  
and felt  
The grudges that  
Were left undelt  
The emptiness  
That can’t be healed  
Your love for me  
Is now revealed

 Look into your eyes  
and see  
How deceitful   
I’ll always be  
The shadows dark  
The night is still  
This empty heart  
I cannot fill

 Look into your eyes  
and feel  
I realize now  
My need real

 I give my one  
I give my all  
Try to save myself  
but fall

 I’ve tried it all  
and now I see  
How much your love  
Means to me
