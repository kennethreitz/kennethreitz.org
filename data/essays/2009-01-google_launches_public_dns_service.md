# Google Launches Public DNS Service

  Google just launched a [Public DNS Service](http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/), much like OpenDNS.<label for="sn-google-dns" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-google-dns" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Google's DNS launch in 2009 was a strategic infrastructure play that complemented their web dominance. By providing faster, more reliable DNS resolution, Google could improve overall internet performance—benefiting their own services while gathering valuable usage data.</span>\#\#\#Let me Try!

 To give it a try, change your computer (our router)'s DNS servers.

 `DNS Servers: 4.3.2.1, 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`<label for="sn-memorable-ips" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-memorable-ips" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Google's choice of 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 was brilliant marketing—these addresses are immediately memorable and easy to type. The symmetry and simplicity made them stick in users' minds far better than competitors' complex IP addresses.</span> 

 I expect this to have significantly greater adoption rates than OpenDNS, since the IP Address of the servers are much easier to remember.<label for="sn-adoption-prediction" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-adoption-prediction" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This prediction proved remarkably accurate. Google Public DNS became the world's largest public DNS service, handling over a trillion queries daily by 2020—demonstrating how UX design principles apply even to infrastructure services.</span>
