# Google Launches Public DNS Service

  Google just launched a [Public DNS Service](http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/), much like OpenDNS.\#\#\#Let me Try!

 To give it a try, change your computer (our router)'s DNS servers.

 `DNS Servers: 4.3.2.1, 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4` 

 I expect this to have significantly greater adoption rates than OpenDNS, since the IP Address of the servers are much easier to remember.
