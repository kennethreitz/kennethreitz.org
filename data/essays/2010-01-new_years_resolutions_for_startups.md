# New Years Resolutions for Startups
*January 2010*





  Here's a small list of 2009 *New Year's Resolutions* for your startup.

> **Analytical Note**: Written during the post-2008 financial crisis period, these resolutions reflect a back-to-basics approach to startup philosophy. The emphasis on simplicity and resource consciousness likely emerged from observing the failures of over-funded, over-complicated ventures during the dot-com bubble years.

  ### 1. Simplify

 Anyone can make something complex. It takes thoughtful planning, consideration, and discipline to make something simple. Simple \= elegant. The same applies to your business.

> **Design Philosophy**: This echoes Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry's famous quote: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." In startup contexts, this translates to focusing on core value propositions rather than feature bloat.

 ### 2. Get some Humility

 Don't assume you know what your audience wants. [Find out first](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/13/how-to-create-a-global-phenomenon-for-less-than\10000/).

> **Validation Strategy**: This predates the "lean startup" methodology by Eric Ries, yet captures the same essential principle. The linked Tim Ferriss example demonstrates the power of rapid market validation before significant investment.

 ### 3. Release a Real Product

 10,000 great ideas are worthless if you never act upon them. Pick one. Pick three and mix. Release.

> **Execution Imperative**: This reflects the "ideas are cheap, execution is everything" philosophy prevalent in 2009 startup culture. The "pick three and mix" approach anticipates the mashup economy and API-driven development that would dominate the 2010s.

 ### 4. The Opposite is Also True

 Your product can be enormously successful for a single feature. Someone else's product will be even more successful for excluding that same feature.

> **Market Paradox**: This insight demonstrates understanding of market segmentation and the "paradox of choice." It anticipates the success of minimalist products like Instagram (focusing only on photo sharing) versus more complex platforms.

 ### 5. Loose the Bulk

 Startups \[don't need much](http://cdixon.tumblr.com/post/311546950/things\-startups\-do\-and\-dont\-need). The more you spend, the less you earn. Keep things small. Keep things simple. You'll thrive.

> **Resource Optimization**: This pre-cloud computing advice reflects the era when server costs and infrastructure were significant barriers. The principle remains relevant: premature scaling often kills startups faster than market rejection.
