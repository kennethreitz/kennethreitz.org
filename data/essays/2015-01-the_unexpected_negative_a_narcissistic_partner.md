This attitude has served me very well over the years. However, if you take a look at my [core ideals and values](http://www.kennethreitz.org/values/), you'll see one very important line item that I've been forced to revisit lately:


> Positivity. Negative atmospheres are toxic. Remove yourself from them.

 Normally, for me, this means to remove my negative perception about a given situation. Sometimes, it means to give myself space from a political environment or project which is having a toxic effect on me. But, I've been reminded lately, through a very painful experience, that negativity can take many ugly forms, *including that of other people*.

 The past year of my life has been an absolute rollercoaster of emotion — the highest of highs mixed with the lowest of lows. This newfound source of profound inspiration came to me in the form of a new relationship.

 No amount of optimism can change the fact that sometimes, people *will* take advantage of you, in very unexpected and *sinister* ways.

 I am writing this article because reading someone else's story woke me up to the fact that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship — perhaps it will help you too. This experience with manipulation and emotional abuse later informed understanding of [how systems can systematically exploit psychological vulnerabilities](/essays/2025-08-26-algorithmic_mental_health_crisis), whether in personal relationships or through technology platforms.

 Emotional (e.g. spiritual) abuse is often overlooked, considered less harmful than physical or sexual abuse — but research shows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Emotional abuse can leave a very successful, kind, and confident person feeling crazy, emotionally unstable, and out of control. Before you know what has happened, you have lost your well\-established sense of self\-respect, confidence, pride, and trust\-worthiness. The abuser considers your most admirable traits, like vulnerability and empathy, as weaknesses and exploits them to achieve their self\-serving goals. Over time, if you stay with the abuser, you start to doubt the very foundations of what make you *you*.
