# Windows Mobile and iPhone OS
*January 2009*





  I've owned about 5 WIndows Mobile devices, 3 Palm Devices, and 1 iPhone<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's extensive mobile device experience spans the critical transition period from PDAs to smartphones. His hardware journey mirrors the broader industry evolution from business-focused devices to consumer-centric platforms, providing credibility to his comparative analysis.</span>.

 What we all need:

 * Simplicity
* Power
* Reliability
* Speed
* Integration

 **Palm OS** (Pre\-Pre haha):

 * Simple. Very Simple.
* Does what it needs to do and doesn't falter.
* Not much in terms of applications.
* Most certainly not designed for a mobile professional.
* It's a glorified rolodex<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">The "glorified rolodex" characterization captures Palm's fundamental limitation: being designed for the pre-internet age of contact management rather than the connected, multimedia future that smartphones would enable. This observation proved prophetic as Palm failed to adapt to the smartphone era.</span>.

 **Windows Mobile** (5, 6, 6\.1\):

 * Attempts to satisfy someone who needs to read spreadsheets on the go.
* Very slow and unstable. Not good for phone use. At all.
* Integration is sub\-par.
* Lots of work\-arounds for lots of things, nothing is simple.
* Fonts are ugly.
* Interface is clunky.

 **iPhone OS**:

 * Smooth, and very nice looking.
* Font rendering is exceptional.
* Web browsing is a dream.
* Did I mention how good it looks?
* Fantastic applications, integration, and standards.
* Apps need approval (good and bad)<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's nuanced view of Apple's App Store approval process in 2009 was remarkably prescient. The "good and bad" assessment acknowledges both quality control benefits and innovation constraints—a debate that continues to shape platform policies across the tech industry today.</span>.
* Very fast. Very slick. Problem free.

 **Verdict**:

 iPhone OS simply cannot be beat. It's perfect. I haven't used Android, but it's more of a platform than an intended out\-of\-the\-box Mobile OS<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This early insight into Android's architecture proved remarkably accurate. Kenneth recognized that Android's strength lay in its customizability and platform flexibility rather than consumer polish—a distinction that would define the iPhone vs. Android rivalry for the next decade.</span>. You aren't intended to use the built\-in Window Manager if you don't want to. Windows Mobile: pay attention.
