# OpenDNS Finally Monetizes

*2009 Internet Infrastructure: Before Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 (2018) and widespread awareness of DNS privacy, OpenDNS pioneered the concept of alternative public DNS with performance and security benefits over ISP defaults.*

  I've been a long\-time fan and user of **[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com)**, the free and often\-superior DNS Server. I've always noticed drastic improvements in my site loading speeds when using the service (due to drastically improved domain name lookups). There's really no downside to using the system. It's significantly faster than most ISP's own DNS servers, and it's updated far more frequently.\#\#Announcing OpenDNS Monetization*Freemium Monetization Strategy: OpenDNS pioneered the SaaS model for infrastructure services - offer free tier to build user base, then monetize with premium features and enterprise offerings.*
