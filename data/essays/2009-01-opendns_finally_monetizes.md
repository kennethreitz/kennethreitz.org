# OpenDNS Finally Monetizes
*January 2009*

I've been a long-time fan and user of **[OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com)**, the free and often-superior DNS Server. I've always noticed drastic improvements in my site loading speeds when using the service (due to drastically improved domain name lookups). There's really no downside to using the system. It's significantly faster than most ISP's own DNS servers, and it's updated far more frequently.<label for="sn-dns-context" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Before Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 (2018) and widespread awareness of DNS privacy, OpenDNS pioneered the concept of alternative public DNS with performance and security benefits over ISP defaults.</span>

## Announcing OpenDNS Monetization

OpenDNS now offers a new service called **OpenDNS Deluxe**, which is tailed for the average household as well as smaller companies.<label for="sn-monetization" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

### Premium Support

It allows users to have an ad-free experience and have priority over free members.

The price for this service is only $9.95 a year. Not too bad!

### For Power Users

They are also offering a very robust **OpenDNS Enterprise** edition for medium to fortune 500 companies. It has many advanced features such as: delegated administration, advanced reporting, and malware site protection.

### Pricing

That price isn't listed :)<label for="sn-enterprise-pricing" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
