# Hello, World!

I have a new website. I'm trying to focus on providing simple context into my projects and interests, as well as providing a platform for my writing — whenever that may be.

## Tech Stack

I wanted to keep things simple, and also not use a static site generator, as I want
to have some dynamic content when hosting my photos, eventually.

For those of you who have been following my blog, I'm still working on getting
my old posts migrated over. I'll be adding more content in the coming weeks,
so stay tuned!
