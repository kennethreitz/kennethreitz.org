# Happy Hacker's Keyboard

Over the years, I've spent a lot of time working on a lot of different hardware configurations. I've tried all sorts of keyboards, mice, displays, and other peripherals. I've gone through phases of using different setups for different tasks, but I've always come back to a few key pieces of hardware that I just can't seem to live without.

I recently "came back to" an older setup of mine, which I used for many, many years and was very happy with. I thought I'd share it with you.

## The Keyboard

After a long hiatus, I'm happy to share that I'm typing this on a [HHKB](https://amzn.to/3yMK9zi), like I used to for many years. I'm not really sure what compelled me to ditch it in the first place, but I'm glad to be back.

This keyboard uses Topre switches, which are a bit different from the Cherry MX switches that are so popular these days. They're a bit quieter and have a unique feel that I find very satisfying.

Some would argue that they're the best switches out there, and I'm inclined to agree.

## The Display

I'm also using a [5K Apple Studio Display](https://amzn.to/3SW2TTH), which is a new addition to my setup. It's a bit of a change from the 4K displays I've been using, but I'm enjoying the extra screen real estate.

This keyboard is such a joy to type on. I've tried many other keyboards, but
none of them have the same feel as the HHKB. I'm so happy to be back.

Just wanted to share. Have a great day!
