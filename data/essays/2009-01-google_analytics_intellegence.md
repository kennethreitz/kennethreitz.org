It's called [Intelligence](http://analytics.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-feature-spotlight-analytics.html).<label for="sn-early-ai" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">This 2009 post documents one of Google's first attempts at bringing "intelligence" to analytics - a precursor to modern AI-driven insights. The careful disclaimer about not replacing analysts reflects the cautious approach to AI augmentation that characterized this era, before machine learning became ubiquitous.</span>

## What They Have To Say

> Your new hardworking assistant, Analytics Intelligence, can't replace you or a professional analyst. But, it can find key information for you and your professional analysts -- so that your team can focus on making strategic decisions, instead of sifting through an endless sea of data.

Intriguing.<label for="sn-historical-perspective" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

This conservative positioning reflects 2009's limited computational capabilities and the nascent state of machine learning applications in business intelligence.</span>
