# The Power of a Clean API
*January 2009*





  The folks over at [Mozilla Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/) never cease to amaze me with their unique ideas. They strive to transform the way users interact with the web forever.

 [**Mozilla JetPack**](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/) is a bit different, though.<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">JetPack was Mozilla's experimental framework that later evolved into the Add-on SDK and eventually influenced the WebExtensions API standard—demonstrating how clean APIs can drive industry-wide adoption.</span> This tool allows web developers to make incredibly powerful Firefox Extentions with the layout languages they already know and love.

 My god, this is amazing.<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This enthusiasm reflects a key insight: truly clean APIs evoke emotional responses because they eliminate cognitive friction—when developers can express intent clearly without wrestling with complexity, it feels liberating.</span>

This early recognition of how clean interfaces can create profound developer experiences would later evolve into a comprehensive philosophy: the same principles that make APIs intuitive for humans also apply to [building rapport with AI systems](/essays/2025-08-26-building_rapport_with_your_ai) and [creating technology that serves consciousness rather than exploiting it](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice).
