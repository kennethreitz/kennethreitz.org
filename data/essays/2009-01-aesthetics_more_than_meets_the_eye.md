# Aesthetics: More Than Meets the Eye
*January 2009*





  I was doing some routine poking around the [TextMate Wiki](http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/HomePage) tonight, and I came across an [amazing mod](http://jason-evers.com/code/code-like-i-do). Amazing.<label for="sn-textmate-era" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-textmate-era" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This captures the 2009 era when TextMate was the editor of choice for Mac developers, before the rise of Sublime Text and VSCode. Kenneth's excitement about customization themes reflects the broader hacker culture's emphasis on personalizing development environments.</span> After installing it, my favorite editor looked brand new, and I started hacking away at code for hours.

 Customized (yet clean) interfaces really help me focus on my work.<label for="sn-cognitive-load" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cognitive-load" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This insight predates the formal research on cognitive load in programming environments. Studies later confirmed that visual aesthetics directly impact productivity and code quality—dark themes reduce eye strain and improve focus during extended coding sessions.</span> Working in an IDE with a black background just feels right to me. I wasn't nearly as satisfied with my .NET development when using the default [Visual Studio color scheme](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/06/Join-the-Dark-Side-of-Visual-Studio.aspx). I found the dark and everything became better. I felt more at home. I looked at it and it made me smile.

 Just a thought.<label for="sn-philosophy-simplicity" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-philosophy-simplicity" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Even in this brief early essay, we see Kenneth's emerging philosophy that aesthetics aren't superficial but fundamental to how we experience and interact with technology. This theme would later permeate his approach to API design and user experience in his open source work.</span>

This early recognition—that aesthetic choices shape our relationship to technology and our capacity for productive work—would evolve into a deeper understanding: whether designing [APIs for humans](/themes/for-humans-philosophy), [building rapport with AI systems](/essays/2025-08-26-building_rapport_with_your_ai), or approaching [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice), the quality of our interfaces shapes the quality of our consciousness.
