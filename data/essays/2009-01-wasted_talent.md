# Wasted Talent

  I'd say that 95% percent of the students that I met at George Mason University my Freshman year had *no idea* why they were even there. This is so sad.

 For me, going to college was more about getting out of the house than anything else. And it worked. I did get out of the house. And I learned alot. I found my passion.

 Other students worked their butts off trying to take as many credits as possible, and when asked what they want to do for a living they don't have the slightest idea. Why would you go to college if you don't even know what you want to major in? I would think that spending all that money would be in order to achieve a goal, but apparently not.

 *They are just along for the ride.*
