# I Finally Got a MacBook

  Yesterday I stopped by the Apple store in Fair Oaks Shopping Center in Fairfax, VA and finally purchased a MacBook. I've been wanting one for quite a while – ever since I fell deeply in love with OS X after adopting an old 12" G4 PowerBook I've been using for the past 5 months.

  I decided to get the 2\.5 GHz 13" MacBook Pro. This will be my full\-time machine for the next 4\+ years hopefully. With specs this good and a case this sturdy, I see no reason why it shouldn't last me for years to come.

 I am thoroughly pleased with the purchase so far. If you've been planning on getting a MacBook, *now is the time to get one*. The base line 13" Aluminum Pro model is only $1100 right now – cheaper than most of the refurbished polycarbonates with lower specs. Anyway, I'll post lists of my software choices (including TextMate Plugins and Bundles) soon for those interested. Stay tuned!
