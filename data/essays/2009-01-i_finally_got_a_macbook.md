# I Finally Got a MacBook

  Yesterday I stopped by the Apple store in Fair Oaks Shopping Center in Fairfax, VA and finally purchased a MacBook. I've been wanting one for quite a while – ever since I fell deeply in love with OS X after adopting an old 12" G4 PowerBook I've been using for the past 5 months.

  I decided to get the 2\.5 GHz 13" MacBook Pro. This will be my full\-time machine for the next 4\+ years hopefully. With specs this good and a case this sturdy, I see no reason why it shouldn't last me for years to come.

 I am thoroughly pleased with the purchase so far. If you've been planning on getting a MacBook, *now is the time to get one*. The base line 13" Aluminum Pro model is only $1100 right now – cheaper than most of the refurbished polycarbonates with lower specs. Anyway, I'll post lists of my software choices (including TextMate Plugins and Bundles) soon for those interested. Stay tuned!

> **2025 Note**: This post captures the Mac adoption story of many developers in 2009 - the transition from PowerPC to Intel Macs, and the appeal of OS X as a Unix-based system for development. The $1100 price point for a MacBook Pro reflects pre-inflation pricing that seems almost mythical today. The mention of TextMate plugins and the anticipation around software choices highlights how platform-specific development workflows were in 2009, before cross-platform tools became dominant. This represents a pivotal moment when Apple was successfully courting developers with powerful Unix machines in beautiful hardware.
