# Smoothy TextMate Theme

  I've said it before and I'll say it again: [TextMate](http://kennethreitz.com/blog/if-textmate-42/) is one fantastic text editor.

  Now, I won't bore you with my passion for it, but if you've been reading my blog for long, you know how I feel.I do the majority of my development in TextMate, so theme choice is pretty important (others beg to differ but I disagree â€“ aesthetics are everything). I tried a number of themes and found some really great ones. I'm always partial to darker schemes, so I settled on using Vibrant Ink. Fantastic theme. After a while, I needed a break from the dark background, and decided to find a more minimalist white\-based theme online. Much to my avail, I discovered that there are no good ligher\-colored themes out there for TextMate. Some come close, but nothing hits the nail on the head. So I made one.

 I call it **Smoothy** ([screenshot](http://media.kennethreitz.com.s3.amazonaws.com/themes/Smoothy.tmTheme.gif), [download](http://media.kennethreitz.com.s3.amazonaws.com/themes/Smoothy.tmTheme)).

 So, after a great number of hours, and realizing that making things coordinate on black is far easier than white, I settled on a theme that was colorful, functional, useful, triatic, and most\-importantly, not a piece of crap. Enjoy!
