# Cloud Computing: Yin and Yang
*January 2009*





  Cloud computing enables us. Amazon's EC2 allows anyone in the world to have instant access to incredibly powerful high\-end servers that would usually cost tens of thousands of dollars for pennies on the dollar.

<span class="sidenote">Written in 2009, this prescient observation came just three years after EC2's launch. The democratic potential of cloud computing—making enterprise-level computing power accessible to anyone—would indeed transform software development and entrepreneurship over the following decade.</span>

\#\#Life is good.

 Of course, people use this technology for both good and bad. In fact, a few days ago, someone wrote a tutorial for [Cracking PGP with an Amazon EC2 instance \& EDPR](http://news.electricalchemy.net/2009/10/cracking-passwords-in-cloud.html). Again, life is good.

 **Remember:** if you create an successful open door web service, all people, good and bad, will come.

<span class="sidenote">This insight captures the fundamental duality of technological progress—every tool that democratizes power also democratizes the potential for both creation and destruction. The same computational resources that enable innovation also enable exploitation.</span>
