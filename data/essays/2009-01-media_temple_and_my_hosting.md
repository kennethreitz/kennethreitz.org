# Media Temple and My Hosting

  While I haven't used many hosting services, I must admit that I cannot imagine any being much better than Media Temple.

> **Sidenote**: This early essay reveals Kenneth's preference for premium tools and services—a mindset that would later influence his approach to developer tooling. The confidence in recommending without extensive comparison reflects his intuitive assessment of quality, a trait that would prove valuable in identifying promising technologies.

 Alot of other people use terrible hosting that is less than $5 a month. Don't waste your time. Why are you even on the internet if you are only willing to invest $5 a month for your website?

> **Sidenote**: Kenneth's direct questioning of $5 hosting users reflects his early understanding that infrastructure quality directly impacts user experience. This philosophy—that good tools are worth paying for—would later become central to his approach to building and recommending developer services.

 MediaTemple's Dedicated Virtual server simply cannot be beat. For $50 a month, I get 20GB of storage, 1TB of transfer, and 2x 3GHz Xeon Processors. I have full root access to the machine, and can do whatever I want with it.

> **Sidenote**: The specific technical specifications and emphasis on "full root access" reveal Kenneth's hands-on approach to system administration. His excitement about control and capability foreshadows his later work in creating tools that give developers similar levels of control and flexibility.

 Now thats a hosting company. And that's a server. I'll host you on it if you want – you'll get all the benefits of the $50 a month server, without all the overhead \- plus one geek who's at your service 24/7\. And all for $20 a month.

> **Sidenote**: Kenneth's offer to resell hosting services with personal support ("one geek who's at your service 24/7") demonstrates early entrepreneurial instincts and customer service thinking. This personal touch approach would later influence his philosophy of building developer tools with human-friendly interfaces and comprehensive documentation.
