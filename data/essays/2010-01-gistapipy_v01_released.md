# GistAPI.py v0.1 Released

Today I released GistAPI.py v0.1.2. It features a highly-optimized Gist object model and API wrapper which allows you to consume Gists in your next Python application.

 GitHub just rolled out a miniature pre-release of the [Gist API](http://develop.github.com/p/gist.html) last month, so API functionality is pretty limited at the moment. More features will be added as soon as the API is updated.

 ## Usage

```python
from gistapi import *

gist = Gist('d4507e882a07ac6f9f92')

gist.description # 'Example Gist for gist.py'
gist.created_at # '2010/05/16 10:51:15 -0700'
gist.public # False
gist.filenames # ['exampleEmptyFile', 'exampleFile']
gist.files['exampleFile'] # 'Example file content.'
```
