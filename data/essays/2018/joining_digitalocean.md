I couldn’t be more excited :)

 I'll be at the Digital Ocean booth periodically, if you want to come say hi! I'll also have some presence at the PSF booth as well.

 Heroku will always hold a special place in my heart and soul. I’ve been working there for 6\.5 years, and it’s time for something new :)
