  Hands–down, my favorite possession.

  

   I'm very happy to announce a new section of my website that has technically existed for a long time, as a single page, O*bjects —*which contained a long, flat, and outdated list of links to things I enjoy — has now been expanded into a full section of my website, called—

 ## [Objects I Own \& Love](https://www.kennethreitz.org/objects/home/)

 I plan to continually iterate on this portion of my website, to include new things that need to be mentioned (like the excellent [**TI\-84 Plus CE**](https://amzn.to/2wKA0jh)).

 If you'd like any specific recommendations (or have any of your own), **[drop me an email](mailto:me@kennethreitz.org)**, and I'll be happy to give you my personal opinion, based on your price range.
