# Call for Sponsors: Requests 3.0 Development!

  Dear friends,

 Work on [Requests 3\.0](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/kennethreitz/call-for-sponsors-requests-3-0-development/11004341-www.kennethreitz.org/requests3?c=c83ddad9-42ff-4152-8346-1eaddacd5311)¬†is now underway, paving the way for the future of one of the world's most heavily‚Äìrelied‚Äìupon Python modules.

 After losing our primary open source maintainer (who was sponsored by a company to work on Requests, and other projects, full‚Äìtime), we are seeking community financial contributions towards the development of Requests 3\.0\.

 If you (or your company) uses Requests in a professional context, we encourage you to make a contribution towards our efforts to help make the world a better place (for humans‚Ñ¢).

 [**Learn More**](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/community/sponsors/).

 If you (or your company) would like to support us, but prefer another method of payment, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:me@kennethreitz.org) with your requirements. Sponsorship opportunities (with website placement) are also available, upon request.¬†

 Many thanks,  
Kenneth Reitz
