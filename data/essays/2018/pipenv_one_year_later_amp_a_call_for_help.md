# ​Pipenv: One Year Later &amp; a Call for Help

    ![IMG_0340.JPG](http://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/665498111876725f7613f1e6/1719666519911-3D1JAT0I745BLJOOV2D3/dc4d1-b0c31-img_0340.jpg)![IMG_0340.JPG]()   Last Friday marked the one year anniversary of my latest project, [**Pipenv**](https://docs.pipenv.org/), which is now the [officially recommended](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) packaging tool for the Python community from Python.org.  


 It’s been a lot of hard work — and very humbling to see how warmly (for the most part), the community has embraced the project. 

 ## Latest Updates

 * The documentation receives about 1,700 views per day.
* Pipenv has been installed 97,791 times this month.
* 57% of the installations are using Python 3\.
* The project’s repository has been moved over to the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) organization.
* Nick Coghlan, core CPython developer, has officially joined the team, as a Senior Contributor.

 I’m currently working on releasing [Pipenvlib](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenvlib), a project which makes it easy to interface with Pipenv projects from Python code. 

 There’s been no progress on getting Pipfile added to pip proper — this will likely take a while, as bandwidth is extremely constrained on the pip team.

 ## Moving Forward: a Call to Action

 The Pipenv project needs help — we have too many incoming issues and reported bugs to be able for our small team to handle.

 If you’d like to get involved with the project (and have previous open source experience), we’d love to have you on board. We need more direct contributors to help make this project sustainable. 

 The project will be fine without any additional contributors — but the level of quality we are striving for requires more development man hours than our team is capable of producing at this time.

 So, if you’re qualified and able, please [reach out to me](http://mailto:e@kennethreitz.org), and I’ll set you up ASAP. :)

 Many thanks for reading! And, as always, thanks for using my software :)
