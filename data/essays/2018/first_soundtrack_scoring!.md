# First Soundtrack Scoring!

  Many months ago, I created and scored my first soundtrack for a short film — *Day One* by [Continuity Pictures](https://vimeo.com/user19419092) ([Derek Thomas](http://www.derekadamthomas.com)).

 The process was quite fun — I never watched the film before scoring — I scored as I watched the film for the first time. This allowed for a very authentic sonic expression for the audience.

 I'm very pleased with the results. I believe it's some of my best musical work to date.
