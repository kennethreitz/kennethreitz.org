# The Cost of Transparency: Living with Schizoaffective Disorder in Tech

*"We celebrate mental health awareness until someone actually needs mental health support."*

In [The Inclusion Illusion](/essays/2025-08-26-the_inclusion_illusion), I explored how tech companies perform diversity while quietly eliminating employees who actually need accommodations. What I didn't share was the personal cost of that analysis—how living openly with schizoaffective disorder has systematically excluded me from the very communities I helped build.

Over the past few years, I've worked for at least twenty companies, cycling through positions as organizations discovered my mental health history and found creative ways to make me unwelcome. The pattern is consistent: initial enthusiasm for my technical contributions, followed by discomfort when my condition becomes visible, and finally the inevitable "restructuring" or "cultural fit" conversations that push me toward the exit.

This isn't paranoia—it's pattern recognition honed by lived experience.

## The Mental Health Care Paradox

The discrimination starts in healthcare itself. When I seek treatment for schizoaffective disorder, providers often approach me with a mixture of fear and condescension that would be immediately recognized as unacceptable if directed at any other patient population.

I've had therapists decline to continue working with me without clear explanations, leaving me to wonder whether my openness about my condition or my technical background created discomfort they couldn't navigate. I've had doctors become visibly afraid of me after witnessing me during an acute episode, their fear palpable in subsequent interactions. During inpatient treatment, I've been accused of not taking prescribed medication when I was compliant, as if the persistence of symptoms could only be explained by patient deception rather than the complex reality of treatment-resistant episodes.

The message is clear: people with schizoaffective disorder are expected to be passive victims of their condition, not active participants in their own care. When we demonstrate competence, insight, or agency, we become threatening rather than inspiring.

## Professional Exclusion

In professional settings, the discrimination is more subtle but equally systematic. Companies tout their mental health benefits and neurodiversity initiatives right up until they encounter someone whose mental health needs actual accommodation.

I've been excluded from team meetings after disclosing my condition, with managers explaining they wanted to "reduce stress" for me. I've had colleagues avoid working with me after learning about my diagnosis, their discomfort palpable in every interaction. I've been passed over for promotions with vague explanations about "communication style" that clearly referenced my openness about mental health challenges.

The twenty-plus companies I've cycled through represent a pattern of organizations that genuinely believe they're progressive and inclusive. They sponsor diversity conferences, implement mental health awareness training, and celebrate neurodiversity—until they encounter the reality of what supporting someone with a severe mental illness actually requires.

Each departure follows a similar script: initial excitement about my technical contributions, growing discomfort as my condition becomes visible during routine workplace stress, and finally the careful choreography of making me unwelcome without explicitly mentioning my mental health. It's discrimination by a thousand paper cuts, each individually deniable but collectively devastating.

## Open Source Ostracism

The Python community's response to my mental health advocacy has been particularly painful. This is a community I helped build, one that benefits from tools I created, yet it has systematically excluded me as I've become more open about living with schizoaffective disorder.

I've watched as former collaborators distance themselves, conference invitations dry up, and contributions get scrutinized with a level of suspicion not applied to other developers. The community celebrates the abstract idea of mental health awareness while making it clear that actual mental health disclosure makes you a liability.

The message from open source leadership is unmistakable: you can advocate for mental health in general terms, but if you make your own struggles visible, you become too uncomfortable to include. The very transparency that helped normalize mental health discussions in tech has made me persona non grata in spaces I helped create.

## Personal Relationship Casualties

Perhaps most devastating is how mental health disclosure affects personal relationships. Friends, romantic partners, and social connections often initially express support for mental health awareness, right up until they encounter the reality of schizoaffective disorder.

I've lost friendships when people learned my diagnosis, with former friends suddenly finding excuses to avoid contact. I've had romantic relationships end when partners realized that dating someone with schizoaffective disorder meant occasional difficult conversations about symptoms, medication, and hospitalization risks. I've been excluded from social gatherings where my presence might make others "uncomfortable."

The isolation is profound. The very condition that most requires social support becomes the barrier to accessing it.

## The Fear Behind the Discrimination

What drives this systematic exclusion is fear—fear of the unknown, fear of mental illness, and particularly fear of schizoaffective disorder's association with psychosis. People can intellectually support mental health awareness while being viscerally uncomfortable with conditions that challenge their assumptions about consciousness, reality, and social functioning.

Schizoaffective disorder carries stigma that depression and anxiety don't. People can relate to feeling sad or worried; they cannot relate to experiencing reality differently. The moment someone learns you've had psychotic episodes, you become fundamentally Other in their perception—no longer fully human, no longer fully trustworthy, no longer safe to include.

This fear is reinforced by media portrayals, social stereotypes, and the medical model's emphasis on pathology over person. People see the diagnosis before they see the individual, the condition before the contributions.

## The Cost of Silence vs. The Cost of Transparency

I face an impossible choice: remain silent about my condition and pass as neurotypical, or live authentically and face systematic exclusion. Neither option is sustainable.

Silence means constantly monitoring my behavior for signs that might reveal my condition, avoiding discussions of mental health that might trigger suspicion, and living with the constant anxiety that discovery will lead to rejection. It means being unable to advocate for accommodations I need, being forced to suffer in isolation, and perpetuating the very stigma that makes others afraid to seek help.

Transparency means facing the discrimination I've documented—professional exclusion, social isolation, and the constant emotional labor of educating people about a condition they'd rather not understand. It means accepting that my openness will cost me opportunities, relationships, and belonging in communities I helped create.

But transparency also means modeling that people with schizoaffective disorder can be productive, insightful, and valuable community members. It means challenging the assumptions that drive discrimination. It means refusing to disappear into the shame that society expects from people with severe mental illness.

## What Needs to Change

The pattern of discrimination I've experienced isn't unique—it's systematic. People with schizoaffective disorder face exclusion across all sectors of society, from healthcare to employment to personal relationships. The problem isn't individual prejudice but structural stigma that makes our very existence uncomfortable for others.

Real inclusion means:

**Healthcare providers** who approach patients with schizoaffective disorder as partners in care rather than subjects to be managed. It means recognizing that insight into one's condition is a strength, not a manipulation, and that people with lived experience often understand their needs better than external observers.

**Professional environments** that provide actual accommodation rather than performative awareness. This means flexible work arrangements during symptom management, understanding that medication changes affect performance temporarily, and recognizing that mental health disclosure should be met with support rather than suspicion.

**Communities** that welcome the full spectrum of neurodiversity, including conditions that make people uncomfortable. The Python community, and tech culture generally, must move beyond celebrating abstract diversity toward actually including people whose neurodifference challenges social norms.

**Personal relationships** based on understanding rather than fear. This requires education about schizoaffective disorder, recognition that mental illness doesn't define personality or worth, and commitment to inclusion even when it requires emotional labor.

## Moving Forward

I'm done apologizing for living openly with schizoaffective disorder. The discrimination I've faced isn't my fault—it's a reflection of society's failure to move beyond tokenistic awareness toward genuine inclusion.

My condition doesn't make me less competent, less valuable, or less worthy of belonging. The tools I've created serve millions of developers; the insights I've shared have helped normalize mental health discussions in tech; the transparency I've modeled has encouraged others to seek help rather than suffer in silence.

The twenty companies that couldn't handle my openness about schizoaffective disorder represent their failure, not mine. The professional opportunities lost to stigma reflect society's limitations, not my worth. The relationships that couldn't survive mental health disclosure weren't relationships worth preserving.

I will continue living authentically, advocating openly, and refusing to disappear into the shame that society expects from people with severe mental illness. The cost of transparency has been high, but the cost of silence—both personal and societal—is higher.

People with schizoaffective disorder deserve better than systematic exclusion dressed up as concern. We deserve healthcare that treats us as partners, workplaces that provide actual accommodation, communities that welcome our contributions, and relationships based on understanding rather than fear.

Until that changes, I'll keep paying the cost of transparency—because the alternative is accepting a world where people like me are expected to remain invisible, untreated, and alone.

That's a cost too high to bear.
