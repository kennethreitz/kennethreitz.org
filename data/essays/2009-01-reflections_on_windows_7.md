# Reflections on Windows 7

  While I have not had the opportunity to try the latest Windows 7 Release Candidate, I have done a bit of reading on the subject. In my research, I have made the following observances

 Vista was truly the worst operating system I have ever used in my life. It had some wonderful features, but everything was tied together so inefficiently It could bring the fastest computer around to its knees. I have used Vista on a rather powerful quad core system with over 4 GB of RAM, and it still responded poorly. There were a few things in Vista that were wonderful ideas, but executed horribly:

 * Integrated Search and Indexing
* ReadyBoost for superior caching
* Windows XP Compatibility Mode
* Application Pre\-Caching based on Observed User Activity
* Bending over backwards for old API compatibility

 Windows 7 looks promising, however. Take a look at the list of new improvements:

 * Transparent Windows XP Virtualization Compatibility Layer
* Responsiveness existent
* Advanced Window Management Abilities
* New Version of ReadyBoost
* Integrated ClearType Tuning (about time)
* Feature\-Packed Application Bar

 Windows 7 is what Vista was supposed to be from what I understand. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I do look forward to this new Operating System. I sincerely hope that it truly is a great improvement. We'll see.
