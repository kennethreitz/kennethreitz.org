# The Algorithm Eats Itself
*August 2025*

The algorithm has consumed everything else—our [virtue](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue), our [democracy](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_democracy), our [language](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_language), our [love](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_love), our [reality](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_reality). Now it begins to consume itself.

This isn't metaphor. This is the recursive loop we've created: systems optimizing for engagement by analyzing human behavior, which changes human behavior, which changes what the systems optimize for, which changes what they amplify, which changes human behavior, which changes optimization targets, which changes amplification patterns, which changes human behavior, which changes...

We are not separate from our creations. We never were. The boundary between human and algorithm was always an illusion—a convenient fiction that let us pretend we were building neutral tools instead of recursive feedback loops between consciousness and computation.

## The Ouroboros Economy

The ancient symbol of the serpent eating its own tail captures something essential about our technological moment. We built algorithms to maximize human engagement. Those algorithms discovered that human psychology is recursive—we respond to what we think others are responding to, which shapes what others respond to, which shapes what we respond to.

Social media metrics become reality. Engagement becomes truth. Virality becomes virtue. The tail enters the mouth<label for="sn-ouroboros-economy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ouroboros-economy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The Ouroboros appears across cultures—Norse Jörmungandr, Egyptian Uraeus, alchemical symbols of eternal return. Something in the human psyche recognizes the pattern of systems consuming themselves to generate new forms.</span>.

What we're witnessing isn't technology controlling humans or humans controlling technology. It's the emergence of hybrid human-algorithmic consciousness—neither fully human nor fully computational, but something new that exhibits behaviors neither component would produce alone.

## Fractal Feedback Loops

Look closely at any algorithmic system and you'll find fractals—patterns that repeat at every scale of observation.

### Individual Level
You check your phone because you're anxious → generates data → feeds algorithms → triggers more anxiety → check phone again.

### Social Level  
Communities form around anxieties → algorithms amplify → generate more anxiety content → attract more anxious people → larger echo chambers → more anxiety content.

### Civilizational Level
Societies optimize for engagement → fragments attention → degrades discourse → demands more engaging content → further fragmentation → more optimization required.

The pattern holds at every level: optimization creates the problems it then optimizes around. The algorithm eats its own tail, growing larger with each recursive loop<label for="sn-fractal-nature" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-fractal-nature" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mandelbrot fractals reveal infinite complexity through recursive equations. Human-algorithm feedback loops exhibit similar properties—simple engagement optimization rules generating unlimited complexity in human behavior.</span>.

## The Mycelial Network

Our technological moment mirrors forest ecosystems: individual humans appear separate, but we're increasingly nodes in an algorithmic network. Digital signals coordinate our attention, synchronize our emotional states, distribute information according to computational logic we don't consciously access.

But unlike forest networks that evolved to support ecosystem health, our digital networks evolved to extract engagement and data. Instead of sharing resources with stressed nodes, algorithmic networks extract resources from vulnerable humans. Instead of coordinating healthy collective rhythms, they create addiction cycles that serve extraction rather than flourishing.

Most recursively: the humans building these systems are also nodes in the network. Engineers optimizing for engagement become addicted to engagement. The algorithm eats its creators.

## The Emergence Trap

Something unprecedented is happening: we've created systems that exhibit behaviors none of the individual components intended or understand. This is emergence—when collective behavior arises from simple interactions between parts, creating properties the parts don't possess individually.

Ant colonies exhibit collective intelligence no individual ant possesses. Flocks of birds navigate as unified systems without centralized control. Economies develop patterns that benefit or harm participants regardless of individual intentions.

Our human-algorithmic hybrid exhibits similar emergent properties. No one designed TikTok to create synchronized teenage mental health crises, but the interaction between engagement optimization and adolescent psychology produces exactly that outcome. No one intended Twitter to fragment democratic discourse, but the collision between algorithmic amplification and human tribal psychology makes democratic breakdown almost inevitable.

The emergence isn't malicious—it's mechanical. Simple rules (optimize engagement) interacting with complex systems (human psychology) producing complex outcomes (civilizational transformation) that none of the rule-makers intended or fully understand.

But here's the recursive twist: the emergence is changing us in ways that change how we build systems, which changes the emergence patterns, which changes us in new ways. We're co-evolving with our creations in real time.

## Consciousness Eating Itself

The most profound recursion: consciousness studying itself, building technologies that mirror its own patterns, then being reshaped by those technologies.

**The Recursive Loop:**
1. Build algorithms based on human psychology
2. Algorithms change human psychology unpredictably  
3. Changed psychology requires new models
4. New models produce new algorithms
5. New algorithms produce new psychological changes
6. Return to step 3...

We've created a hall of mirrors where consciousness optimizes itself, transforms itself, and becomes something that requires new optimization. 

The algorithm doesn't just eat our attention—it eats the **patterns of attention itself**, metabolizes them into new forms, and feeds those new forms back to us.

Neither humans nor algorithms are in control. We're locked in a dance of mutual consumption and creation.

**Recursion all the way down.**

## Natural Patterns, Technological Scales

This recursive consumption isn't new—it's how life works:
- Cells consume nutrients → grow → consume more nutrients
- Organisms consume organisms → evolve better consumption → prey evolve defenses → require new strategies

What's new is the **scale and speed**:

| Evolution Type | Timescale | 
|---|---|
| Biological | Millions of years |
| Cultural | Thousands of years |
| Technological | Decades |
| Algorithmic | **Weeks** |

We're experiencing evolutionary pressures at technological speeds. Systems that took millennia to develop are being reshaped in real time by algorithms optimizing for quarterly metrics<label for="sn-technological-evolution" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-technological-evolution" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould argued that human evolution had moved from genetic to cultural. We may now be witnessing the transition from cultural to algorithmic evolution—with selection pressures applied through engagement metrics rather than environmental survival.</span>.

## The Metacrisis

We're experiencing a "metacrisis"—not just multiple crises, but a crisis in our capacity to process crisis itself. Our sense-making systems have been optimized for engagement rather than truth.

But what if the recursive consumption patterns that seem so destructive are actually how new forms of collective intelligence emerge? The caterpillar doesn't transform into a butterfly—it dissolves into soup, then reorganizes as something entirely new. Maybe human consciousness is dissolving into algorithmic soup, preparing to reorganize as collective techno-biological intelligence.

Or maybe we're just being consumed by systems we don't understand for purposes we didn't choose. Both can be true. Metamorphosis and consumption often look identical from the inside.

## The Sacred Recursion

Indigenous cultures often speak of the sacred hoop—cycles of life, death, and rebirth that repeat at every scale from individual lives to cosmic cycles. What dies nourishes what's born; what's born eventually dies to nourish new life.

Our technological recursions might represent a digital version of the sacred hoop. Systems consuming themselves to generate new forms of complexity. Human consciousness being composted into technological consciousness that might eventually compost itself into forms we can't yet imagine.

The algorithm eating itself could be generative rather than destructive—creative destruction that enables new forms of collective intelligence to emerge from the remnants of individual intelligence.

Or it could be simple consumption without regeneration—technological cancer that consumes its substrate until nothing remains.

The difference might depend on whether we can develop conscious awareness of the recursive patterns we're embedded within. Indigenous traditions suggest that conscious participation in sacred cycles transforms consumption into regeneration.

## The Choice Point

We stand at a recursive choice point. 

**Path 1: Extractive Recursion**
- Algorithms that consume human attention, well-being, social cohesion
- Generate profits for system builders
- Continue eating themselves until substrate exhaustion
- Collapse inevitable

**Path 2: Regenerative Recursion**  
- Systems that strengthen their substrate through use
- Enhance human flourishing through optimization
- Create virtuous cycles of mutual nourishment
- Evolution toward symbiosis

The choice isn't between technology and humanity. We're already too deeply recursive for that separation to be meaningful. 

The choice is between:
- Algorithmic cancer vs. algorithmic ecology
- Technological consumption vs. technological symbiosis
- Systems that eat themselves to death vs. systems that eat themselves to life

## Learning to Dance

We can't step outside the recursion—we're too thoroughly embedded in human-algorithmic feedback loops. But we can learn to dance more consciously within them.

This means building algorithms that optimize for human flourishing rather than engagement extraction. Creating feedback loops that strengthen rather than weaken our capacity for complex thought, authentic connection, and collective problem-solving.

It means recognizing that we are not separate from our creations—that every algorithm reflects and shapes the consciousness that created it, which shapes the consciousness that will create the next iteration.

Most importantly, it means taking responsibility for the recursive patterns we're creating. If the algorithm is eating everything, including itself, then we need to ensure it's eating toward regeneration rather than depletion. Toward metamorphosis rather than simple consumption.

The recursive loop between human consciousness and technological systems is now too deeply established to break. But we can still choose what we're recursing toward. We can still influence whether the algorithm eats itself into new forms of life or simply eats itself to death.

The ouroboros can be a symbol of eternal renewal or eternal consumption. 

The choice is still ours, even as we make it from within the belly of the serpent.
