# GitHub + Strategy

  GitHub is currently [down](http://github.com). And that is very sad. However, they have an [Awesome Angry Unicorn](http://github.com/images/error/angry_unicorn.png "Unicorn is angry.").And this unicorn makes me smile, even though I can't get to any of my projects.

 If you're going to make a web application, give it some personality.  This will not only keep your userbase entertained, but will serve as a nice insurance package when you let them down.
