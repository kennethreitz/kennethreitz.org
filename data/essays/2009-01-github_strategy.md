# GitHub + Strategy
*January 2009*





  GitHub is currently [down](http://github.com). And that is very sad. However, they have an [Awesome Angry Unicorn](http://github.com/images/error/angry_unicorn.png "Unicorn is angry.").<label for="sn-github-early-days" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-github-early-days" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This captures GitHub in its early days when outages were more common and the "Angry Unicorn" error page became iconic. Kenneth was clearly an early adopter, recognizing GitHub's importance when it was still a startup struggling with infrastructure challenges.</span>And this unicorn makes me smile, even though I can't get to any of my projects.

 If you're going to make a web application, give it some personality.<label for="sn-personality-design" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-personality-design" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This insight about injecting personality into technology products was prescient. Kenneth recognized early that successful platforms need emotional connection, not just functionality. This philosophy would later influence his approach to creating memorable, human-centered APIs like Requests.</span>  This will not only keep your userbase entertained, but will serve as a nice insurance package when you let them down.
