# New Album, Messengers Rising Available

  I have a (somewhat) new album available, called *Messengers Rising*.

 It was mostly inspired by a previous relationship of mine, as well as coping with being diagnosed with bipolar disorder—experiences explored in depth in [my mental health advocacy writing](/mental-health) and understanding [the complexity of relationships with manipulative partners](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner).

 You can stream it for free on all major services.

 * [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/album/5SAvmM6fgmhESARQRvt2Uj)
* [TIDAL Link](https://tidal.com/album/69460124)
* [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bvusrc65nqwrridybzs5nyryyca?t=Messengers_Rising_-_Infinite_State)

 If anyone wants a lossless copy of the album, feel free to email me, and I'll send you a link in your preferred format. 

 I hope you enjoy it!
