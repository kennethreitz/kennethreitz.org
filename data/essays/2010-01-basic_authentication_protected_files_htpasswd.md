# Basic Authentication Protected Files (htpasswd)

## Here's a snippet for password protecting a directory served by Apache

To set this up, just add `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` to the desired directory being served by Apache.

 Make sure to [generate your own .htpasswd file](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/).
