# Microsoft Software Running in Linux

*2009 Linux Context: This was peak Linux ideological warfare - before containerization, WSL, and Microsoft's open-source pivot. Running proprietary software on Linux was seen as philosophical betrayal by purists.*

  A few months ago, I wrote a small article for [ProgramerFish](http://programmerfish.com/) that was [featured on SlashDot's Front Page](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215). It was amazing. Within hours, my post had thousands of views and hundreds of comments. People both loved and hated the idea.


 But what made [my post](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215) so popular? The fact that I showed people how to run a very popular piece of proprietary software in Linux. And this made a very large number of people very angry. Why though? Half the users of linux are openly against proprietary software.

 But Certainly software is just a means to an end, not and end itself.

 They failed to see the point. All they cared about was letting everyone else know how much they hated my idea.


 I inadvertently started a mini\-controversy. And it got attention.


 Sometimes the best way to be heard is to say something people don't like to hear.
