# Microsoft Software Running in Linux

*2009 Linux Context: This was peak Linux ideological warfare - before containerization, WSL, and Microsoft's open-source pivot. Running proprietary software on Linux was seen as philosophical betrayal by purists.*

  A few months ago, I wrote a small article for [ProgramerFish](http://programmerfish.com/) that was [featured on SlashDot's Front Page](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215). It was amazing. Within hours, my post had thousands of views and hundreds of comments. People both loved and hated the idea.

*Viral Controversy: SlashDot front page placement was the ultimate tech validation in 2009, often generating massive flame wars. This touched the third rail of Linux philosophy - pragmatism vs. ideological purity.*

 But what made [my post](http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/17/2235215) so popular? The fact that I showed people how to run a very popular piece of proprietary software in Linux. And this made a very large number of people very angry. Why though? Half the users of linux are openly against proprietary software.

 But Certainly software is just a means to an end, not and end itself.

 They failed to see the point. All they cared about was letting everyone else know how much they hated my idea.

*Meta-Commentary on Attention Economics: This observation about controversy driving engagement predates our modern understanding of algorithmic amplification, yet captures the same underlying human psychology.*

 I inadvertently started a mini\-controversy. And it got attention.

*Provocation Strategy: This insight about contrarian positioning as a communication tactic reflects early understanding of attention economy dynamics that would later dominate social media discourse.*

 Sometimes the best way to be heard is to say something people don't like to hear.
