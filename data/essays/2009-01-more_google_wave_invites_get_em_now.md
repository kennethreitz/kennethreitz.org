# More Google Wave Invites! Get 'em now!

*2009 Tech Zeitgeist: Google Wave represented the peak of Gmail-era invite culture, where exclusive beta access created artificial scarcity and social currency around new technology platforms.*

*Invitation Economy: The requirement to 'be creative' for access reflects how early social platforms used gatekeeping mechanisms to cultivate engaged communities and manage server load during scaled rollouts.*

 If you'd like an invite, leave a comment and be creative!

*Digital Proof: The S3-hosted screenshot serves as verification in an era before easy screenshot manipulation, demonstrating the trust-but-verify culture of early social web interactions.*
