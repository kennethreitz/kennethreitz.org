# Google Docs Now Supports All Filetypes

<aside class="sidenote">
<strong>Cloud Storage Evolution:</strong> This post captures a pivotal moment in cloud storage history. In 2010, file synchronization was still nascent - Dropbox had just launched in 2008, and the idea of storing "any filetype" in the cloud was revolutionary. Google's move into general file storage would eventually lead to Google Drive, fundamentally changing how we think about file management.

  For an extra $5 a month, \[Evernote](http://evernote.com) lets you upload a file of any extension to their servers. This is a fantastic feature for developers who like to keep their random psd and 3ds files in sync with the cloud.Looks like Google finally took the hint. Within the next few weeks, they will be rolling out (in the typical staggered unveiling) the ability to upload up to 1 GB of files to Google Docs. 

 Additional storage space will be $0\.25 / GB / Year. That's one tenth the price of Amazon S3!

<strong>Pricing Disruption:</strong> Google's aggressive pricing strategy - undercutting Amazon S3 by 90% - showcases the early cloud wars. This competitive pricing would force the entire industry to reassess storage costs, ultimately benefiting developers and consumers. Today's nearly-free cloud storage stems from this era of intense price competition.
