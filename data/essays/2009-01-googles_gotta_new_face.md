> **2025 Note**: This post captures a moment of web experimentation when Google was testing interface changes through cookie manipulation. The JavaScript snippet represents early web "hacking" culture - using browser tricks to access experimental features. This reflects the more open, experimental nature of early 2009 web development, before modern security practices made such cookie manipulation less viable. It's a time capsel of when web interfaces were more malleable and users could easily peek behind the curtain of major platforms.
