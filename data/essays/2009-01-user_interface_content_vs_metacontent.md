# User Interface: Content vs. MetaContent

  Trey of lopsa.org wrote a  [fantastic article](http://lopsa.org/node/1566) on the the techie vs. non\-techie divide. If you are in the user\-interface market, I suggest you read this. It sheds some wonderful light on this great divide.\#\# In ShortOrdinary Users only see and understand content in a system. Developers and Techies implicitly understand the Metadata that surrounds that content at such an intimate level that they build systems that subconsciously further the divide.

 Good Stuff.
