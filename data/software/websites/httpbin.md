# httpbin.org

[httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/) is a simple HTTP request and response service. It is a useful tool for testing HTTP clients and debugging webhooks. The service provides a variety of endpoints that return different types of data, such as headers, IP address, and user-agent.

<span class="sidenote">HTTPBin fills a crucial gap in web developmentâ€”providing a reliable, predictable HTTP endpoint for testing. Before its creation, developers often had to create their own test servers or use unreliable third-party services, making HTTPBin an essential tool in the modern web development toolkit.</span>

## Features

- **HTTP Methods**: httpbin.org supports various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, allowing you to test different types of requests.
- **Request Inspection**: The service allows you to inspect the details of the incoming request, such as headers, query parameters, and body content.
- **Response Formats**: httpbin.org can return responses in different formats, such as JSON, HTML, and images, enabling you to test how your client handles different content types.
- **Status Codes**: The service can return specific HTTP status codes, such as 200 OK, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error, allowing you to test error handling in your client.
- **Authentication**: httpbin.org supports basic authentication, allowing you to test how your client handles authenticated requests.
- **Dynamic Data**: The service can generate dynamic data, such as random JSON responses or images of a specified size, enabling you to test edge cases in your client.

## Running with Docker

You can also run httpbin.org locally using Docker. First, pull the httpbin image from Docker Hub:

<span class="sidenote">The Docker containerization of HTTPBin demonstrates Kenneth's forward-thinking approach to infrastructure. By providing a self-contained testing service, developers can maintain consistent testing environments regardless of network conditions or external service availability.</span>

```bash
$ docker pull kennethreitz/httpbin
```

Then, run the httpbin container:

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

This will start the httpbin service on port 80 of your local machine, allowing you to interact with it using your HTTP client of choice.
