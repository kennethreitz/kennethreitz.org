# python-guide.org

[`python-guide.org`](https://python-guide.org/) is a comprehensive guide to Python programming, covering topics such as best practices, code style, and project structure. The guide aims to provide developers with a set of guidelines and recommendations for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code.

<span class="sidenote">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python emerged from Kenneth's frustration with scattered and often conflicting Python advice online. By creating a centralized, opinionated guide, he provided the Python community with a definitive resource for best practices.</span>

## O'Reilly Book

The website was converted into a book published by O'Reilly Media, titled "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python."

The book covers a wide range of topics, including Python installation, virtual environments, package management, testing, documentation, and deployment. It serves as a valuable resource for both beginner and experienced Python developers looking to improve their coding practices and workflows.

<span class="sidenote">The transformation from web guide to published O'Reilly book represents a significant achievement in technical writing. Few open source documentation projects achieve such recognition, demonstrating the exceptional quality and community value of Kenneth's work.</span>
