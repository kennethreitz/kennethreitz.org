# strainsdb.org


[`strainsdb.org`](https://strainsdb.org/) is a simple Django app that contains information about various strains of cannabis. It was made as a proof of concept for using AI to generate content for a website.

The app allows users to browse different strains, view details about each strain, and search for specific strains based on their characteristics.

Each strain also contains terpene information, which is extracted from `gpt-3.5` using [instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com) and stored in SQLite.
