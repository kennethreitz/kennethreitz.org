# clint — CLI App Toolkit

This is a very old project (one of my first)<label for="sn-early-cli" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-early-cli" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Clint was created in the early 2010s when Python CLI tooling was far less mature, predating modern frameworks like Click (2014) and Typer (2019).</span>, and I don't recommend using it. It's not maintained, and there are much better options available now.

Clint is a Python library that provides a set of utilities for building command-line applications. It simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) by providing a high-level API for defining commands, arguments, and options.

## Key Features

- **Command Definition:** Clint allows you to define commands and subcommands with associated functions to execute.
- **Argument Parsing:** It provides utilities for parsing command-line arguments and options.
- **Output Formatting:** Clint supports various output formats, including tables, JSON, and plain text.
- **Interactive Prompts:** You can create interactive prompts for user input using the `prompt` function.
- **Colorful Output:** Clint provides utilities for coloring and styling console output.
- **Error Handling:** It includes utilities for handling errors and exceptions in command-line applications.
- **Cross-Platform:** Clint works on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Extensible:** You can extend Clint with custom commands, options, and output formatters.
- **Legacy:** Clint is a legacy project and is no longer actively maintained.

## Alternatives

While Clint was a popular choice for building CLIs in Python, there are now better alternatives available that offer more features and better performance. Some popular CLI libraries include:

- **Click:** A powerful and user-friendly CLI framework for Python<label for="sn-click-influence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Click, created by Armin Ronacher, revolutionized Python CLI development with its decorator-based approach and became the foundation for many modern Python applications.</span>.
- **Typer:** A fast and modern CLI library built on top of Click.
- **Docopt:** A command-line interface description language that generates parser code in Python.
- **Argparse:** The standard library module for parsing command-line arguments in Python.
- **Textual:** A modern and intuitive library for building interactive command-line applications<label for="sn-textual-tui" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Textual represents the evolution toward rich terminal user interfaces (TUIs), offering widget-based layouts and sophisticated interactivity that goes far beyond traditional CLI patterns.</span>.
