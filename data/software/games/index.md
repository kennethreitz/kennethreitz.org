## Design Philosophy

These games reflect the broader "For Humans" design philosophy applied to game developmentâ€”simple, intuitive controls that create immediate accessibility while providing depth through challenging gameplay. The minimalist approach strips away unnecessary complexity to focus on core mechanics that create engaging experiences.

The choice to release these games as open-source aligns with the broader commitment to sharing knowledge and tools that others can learn from and build upon.
