# Records: SQL for Humans

Records is a library for working with tabular data in Python, accessible via SQL. It is powered by [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and provides a high-level API for interacting with databases using SQL queries. Records simplifies the process of working with databases by abstracting away the complexities of SQL and providing a more user-friendly interface.

Database support includes RedShift, Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MS-SQL (drivers not included).

Records offers full [tablib](/software/tablib) integration, allowing you to easily convert query results to tabular data formats like CSV, JSON, and Excel — and even dataframes.
