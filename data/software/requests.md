    $ uv pip install requests

This project is downloaded over 20 million times a day, and is widely used in the Python community. It is known for its ease of use and powerful features, making it a go-to choice for developers who need to work with HTTP in their Python projects.

**Fun fact**: the logo of the Requests project is a [tattoo]() that I have on my right arm.
