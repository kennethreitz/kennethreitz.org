# osx-gcc-installer

This legacy project is no longer maintained, but at one point it was used by many, especially in the Rails community, to install GCC on OSX.

At the time, Apple only provided a version of GCC bundled with Xcode, so every developer had to install an 8 GiB package just to get a C compiler. This project provided a lightweight alternative.

**Fun fact:** this project directly helped to inspire the `$ xcode-select --install` command we all use today.
