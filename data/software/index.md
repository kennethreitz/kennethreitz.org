Here is a list of some of my software projects.

You can find more projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kennethreitz).<label for="sn-github" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-github" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">My GitHub shows over 100+ repositories spanning Python libraries, web applications, and experimental projects dating back to 2008.</span> I try to always be working on something new and exciting! That isn't always the case, though.

## Motivations

I write software for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, I write software to solve a problem that I have. Other times, I write software to learn something new. I also write software to help others solve their problems.<label for="sn-problems" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-problems" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This "scratch your own itch" philosophy led to Requests (solving HTTP frustration), Certifi (certificate headaches), and Pipenv (workflow pain points).</span> I have found, however, that the most rewarding software projects are those that are written to help yourself.

I have always had a fascination and love for software and the computers that ran them.<label for="sn-fascination" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-fascination" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This began in childhood with BASIC programming on early computers, evolved through web development, and now includes exploring AI consciousness and digital creativity.</span> It's strange, being in a modern world where software is so prevalent, and yet so few people understand how it works. I have always been drawn to the magic of software, and I love to share that magic with others.

## Philosophy

[PEP 8](/software/websites/pep8-org) is the style guide for Python code.<label for="sn-pep8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-pep8" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">I maintain pep8.org as a clean, readable version of Python's official style guide, making it more accessible to developers worldwide.</span> It is a set of rules that help you write clean, readable code. It is a guide to writing code that is easy to understand and maintain. It is a guide to writing code that is easy to share with others.

I love taking the *Zen of Python* philosophy<label for="sn-zen" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-zen" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Tim Peters' "Zen of Python" (PEP 20) contains 19 guiding principles that influence not just code structure, but API design, documentation, and user experience.</span> and applying it to all areas of life.

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.

I have found this approach to life to be incredibly rewarding. It has helped me to write better code, to be a better person, and to live a better life.

## Languages

I learned `BASIC` and (albeit, very rudimentary) `C` and `Turbo Pascal` when I was a 9 years old. Throught elementary and middle school, I had fun programming my own programs and making my own websites. I learned `Python` in college, and it has been my primary language ever since. I have also written software in `PHP`, `Ruby`, and `Go`.

My "favorite" language is `bash`, overall. I have written a lot of `bash` scripts over the years, and am a big fan of `shellcheck`. It makes you a better person.

## The Future

I think that AI is here to stay, and it *changes our relationship with code*, fundamentally. Because of AI, code can be a trivial artifact of the creative process. It'll take some time to get there, but it's coming. I think, overall, that this is a good thing for humanity. AI has a tendency to *trivialize* code, while also making it more accessible to everyone. This is not ideal for software engineers, or is it? I think it is.

The engine for this website, for example, was made with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a powerful AI that can write code for you. It is a powerful tool that can help you to write better code, faster.

The future is bright!
