Here is a list of some of my software projects.

You can find more projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kennethreitz).
I try to always be working on something new and exciting! That isn't always the case, though.

## Motivations

I write software for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, I write software to solve a problem that I have. Other times, I write software to learn something new. I also write software to help others solve their problems. I have found, however, that the most rewarding software projects are those that are written to help yourself.

I have always had a fascination and love for software and the computers that ran them. It's strange, being in a modern world where software is so prevalent, and yet so few people understand how it works. I have always been drawn to the magic of software, and I love to share that magic with others.

## Philosophy

[PEP 8](/software/websites/pep8-org) is the style guide for Python code. It is a set of rules that help you write clean, readable code. It is a guide to writing code that is easy to understand and maintain. It is a guide to writing code that is easy to share with others.

I love taking the *Zen of Python* philosophy and applying it to all areas of life.

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.

I have found this approach to life to be incredibly rewarding. It has helped me to write better code, to be a better person, and to live a better life.

## Languages

I learned `BASIC` and (albeit, very rudimentary) `C` and `Turbo Pascal` when I was a 9 years old. Throught elementary and middle school, I had fun programming my own programs and making my own websites. I learned `Python` in college, and it has been my primary language ever since. I have also written software in `PHP`, `Ruby`, and `Go`.

My "favorite" language is `bash`, overall. I have written a lot of `bash` scripts over the years, and am a big fan of `shellcheck`. It makes you a better person.

## The Future

I think that AI is here to stay, and it *changes our relationship with code*. Code is no longer purely an expression of logic, but also an expression of creativity (as it has always been) ‚Äî but, I think that AI will help us all to write better code, lowering the barrier to entry to becoming better programmers, and to live better lives.

The engine for this website, for example, was made with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a powerful AI that can write code for you. It is a powerful tool that can help you to write better code, faster.

The future is bright!
