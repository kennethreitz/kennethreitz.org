# Unmastered Impulses

*Unmastered Impulses* by **Infinite State** is a collection of songs that I wrote and recorded in 2016. The album is my first, and was a joy to make.

Almost the entire album uses analog equipment. Some samples are used throughout (one of the tracks is almost entirely samples), but the majority of the sounds are from my analog synthesizers. I was (and am) very proud of this.

The album was created using Ableton Live, and a suite of analog synthesizers. The album is a collection of 13 tracks, each with its own unique sound and style.

The album is available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms.
