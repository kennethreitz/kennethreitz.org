# Unmastered Impulses

*Unmastered Impulses* by **Infinite State** is a collection of songs that I wrote and recorded in 2016. The album is my first, and was a joy to make.

<span class="sidenote">The title "Unmastered Impulses" carries dual meaning: technically, it refers to the raw, unmastered audio quality that preserves the organic character of the recordings. Philosophically, it represents authentic creative expression—impulses unfiltered by industry expectations or commercial polish.</span>

Almost the entire album uses analog equipment. Some samples are used throughout (one of the tracks is almost entirely samples), but the majority of the sounds are from my analog synthesizers. I was (and am) very proud of this.

<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's pride in analog synthesis reflects his broader philosophy about authentic tools and processes. Just as he championed human-friendly APIs in programming, he embraces analog synthesizers for their tactile, immediate relationship between intention and sound—no abstractions, just direct electrical manipulation of waveforms.</span>

The album was created using Ableton Live, and a suite of analog synthesizers. The album is a collection of 13 tracks, each with its own unique sound and style.

The album is available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms.
