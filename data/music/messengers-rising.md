# Messengers Rising

*Messengers Rising* is a 2017 album I wrote and produced using Ableton Live, and a suite of analog synthesizers. The album is a collection of 14 tracks, each with its own unique sound and style. The album is available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms.

<span class="sidenote">The title "Messengers Rising" suggests communication from higher realms or consciousness states, reflecting Kenneth's interest in spiritual themes. The blend of Ableton Live's digital precision with analog synthesizers creates a bridge between technological and organic soundscapes.</span>

<span class="sidenote">The 14-track structure allows for extended musical narratives, each track contributing to an overarching sonic journey. This approach reflects Kenneth's understanding of user experience design applied to album constructionâ€”creating coherent flow while maintaining individual track identity.</span>
