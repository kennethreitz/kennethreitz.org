I am an electronic musician, named **Infinite State**<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">The name "Infinite State" reflects both musical concepts (endless sonic possibilities) and computing concepts (state machines), bridging Kenneth's dual interests in technology and electronic music composition.</span>, on hiatus.

Between 2012 and 2018, producing electronic music was my primary creative outlet<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">This period coincided with Kenneth's most productive open source development years, suggesting that musical creativity and coding creativity operated in parallel streams, each informing the other's rhythms and structures.</span>. My music is available on Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, and other streaming platforms.

I don't own any of this equipment any longer<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The deliberate divestment of expensive music equipment reflects Kenneth's philosophy of letting go of material attachments when they no longer serve creative purposes—a practice that mirrors his approach to transferring software projects to new maintainers.</span>.

I now have a small collection of guitars (including a baritone!), but I am not a talented guitarist, by any stretch of the imagination. I use them mostly for meditative purposes.

I am a percussionist, by training, and I have been playing drums for over 20 years<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's percussion background provides foundational understanding of rhythm and timing that influences both his musical compositions and his approach to software architecture—understanding that good systems, like good music, depend on precise timing and rhythmic structure.</span>. I used to take this part of my life very seriously (marching band, *&c*.), but I don't play much anymore. When I do play, I prefer to use hand drums, like the djembe or the cajon.
