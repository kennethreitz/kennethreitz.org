I am an electronic musician, named **Infinite State**, on hiatus.

Between 2012 and 2018, producing electronic music was my primary creative outlet. My music is available on Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, and other streaming platforms.

### Gear Used:

- Ableton Live & Push 1/2
- Moog Voyager
- Moog Sub37
- Korg Volca Keys
- Arturia MicroBrute

I don't own any of this equipment any longer.

I now have a small collection of guitars (including a baritone!), but I am not a talented guitarist, by any stretch of the imagination. I use them mostly for meditative purposes.

I am a percussionist, by training, and I have been playing drums for over 20 years. I used to take this part of my life very seriously (marching band, *&c*.), but I don't play much anymore. When I do play, I prefer to use hand drums, like the djembe or the cajon.
