I am an electronic musician, on hiatus.

I have released a handful of albums under the name **Infinite State**. My music is available on Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, and other streaming platforms.

### Gear Used:

- Ableton Live & Push 1/2
- Moog Voyager
- Moog Sub37
- Korg Volca Keys
- Arturia Microbrute
- Arturia Minibrute
- Roland TR-8
- DSI Tempest
- [Eurorack Rig](https://modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/63164)

I don't own any of this equipment any longer. I now have a small collection of guitars, but I don't play them much these days.

I am a percussionist, by training, and I have been playing drums for over 20 years. I used to take this part of my life
very seriously (marching band, *&c*.), but I don't play much anymore. When I do play, I prefer to use hand drums, like the djembe, or the cajon.
