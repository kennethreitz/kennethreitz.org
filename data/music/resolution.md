# Resolution

*Resolution* by **Infinite State** is a collection of songs that I wrote and recorded in 2017. The album was released on July 7, 2017. The album was recorded in my home studio in the spring of 2017.

<span class="sidenote">Resolution represents Kenneth's exploration of electronic music production during a period of intense creative output. The title suggests both musical resolution (harmonic completion) and personal resolution (decision and determination), reflecting themes of closure and new beginnings.</span>

<span class="sidenote">The home studio setting allowed for intimate, experimental soundscapes without the constraints of commercial recording environments. This approach mirrors Kenneth's philosophy of "tools for humans"â€”creating art with accessible, human-scaled technology rather than intimidating professional setups.</span>
