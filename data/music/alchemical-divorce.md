# Alchemical Divorce

*Alchemical Divorce* by **Infinite State** is an EP I created, celebrating the breakup of a toxic relationship. The album is a mix of agressive and electronic sounds, with a focus on healing and transformation.

<span class="sidenote">The term "alchemical divorce" refers to the separation of opposing elements in alchemical tradition—a necessary stage for purification and transformation. Kenneth's use of this concept reframes relationship ending not as failure, but as essential spiritual work toward wholeness.</span>

<span class="sidenote">The juxtaposition of aggressive and electronic sounds mirrors the emotional complexity of leaving toxic relationships—anger at betrayal combined with the mechanistic process of disentangling interconnected lives. The focus on healing suggests music as therapeutic practice.</span>
