# The Algorithm Eats

A comprehensive examination of how algorithmic systems designed for engagement maximization systematically undermine virtue, mental health, language, and human connection.


## Core Thesis

The same algorithmic mechanisms that drive engagement on social platforms—variable reward schedules, outrage amplification, attention fragmentation—systematically destroy the foundations of human flourishing<label for="sn-mechanisms" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-mechanisms" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These mechanisms mirror the psychological manipulation techniques documented in abusive relationships: intermittent reinforcement creates addiction, emotional volatility prevents clear thinking, and fragmented attention inhibits the sustained focus necessary for rational decision-making.</span>. This isn't accidental; it's the inevitable result of optimizing for metrics rather than wellbeing.

Having spent fifteen years creating [software that prioritizes human mental models](/themes/for-humans-philosophy) over technical convenience, I recognize how these systems violate every principle of ethical design<label for="sn-ethical-design" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ethical-design" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ethical design prioritizes user goals over system goals, reduces cognitive load rather than increasing it, and makes complex capabilities more accessible rather than exploiting human psychological vulnerabilities for engagement.</span>: they optimize for corporate benefit rather than user flourishing, they exploit rather than serve human psychology, and they fragment rather than enhance human capability. The same design principles that make good software also make good society—and algorithmic engagement optimization violates all of them.

## Interconnected Patterns

These essays reveal the same underlying mechanism across different domains<label for="sn-pattern-recognition" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pattern-recognition" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This pattern recognition emerges from surviving narcissistic abuse—the same manipulation techniques that destroy individual relationships scale predictably to institutional and algorithmic systems targeting billions of users.</span>:

1. **Engagement Optimization**: Systems designed to maximize time-on-platform and interaction rates—the exact opposite of [tools designed to help users accomplish their goals efficiently](/themes/for-humans-philosophy)<label for="sn-efficiency-paradox" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-efficiency-paradox" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This represents a fundamental inversion of good interface design. While tools like Requests make complex operations simple and efficient, engagement platforms make simple operations complex and time-consuming to maximize usage metrics.</span>
2. **Psychological Exploitation**: Variable reward schedules, social comparison, fear amplification—techniques that mirror [individual manipulation patterns](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner) scaled to billions of users
3. **Reality Distortion**: Algorithmic selection creates biased samples users mistake for representative reality, similar to how [gaslighting distorts individual perception](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner)<label for="sn-reality-distortion" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-reality-distortion" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Algorithmic curation creates the digital equivalent of gaslighting—users experience manufactured reality while being convinced it represents authentic human expression and genuine consensus.</span>
4. **Virtue Inversion**: Behaviors that promote human flourishing are systematically de-prioritized in favor of behaviors that increase engagement metrics
5. **Scale Effects**: Individual psychological manipulation becomes civilizational transformation when mediated by platforms reaching billions of users

**Technical Recognition**: Having built systems that [reduce cognitive load](/software/requests) and [serve user intentions](/themes/for-humans-philosophy), I recognize how current platforms do the opposite—they increase cognitive load, fragment attention, and serve platform intentions rather than user goals. This isn't accidental complexity; it's engineered manipulation.

## Historical Context

This critique emerges from lived experience with both technological innovation and psychological manipulation:

The technical expertise to recognize these patterns developed through decades of software work:

- **Human-Centered Design Experience**: Creator of [Requests](/software/requests), [Pipenv](/software/pipenv), and other ["for humans" tools](/software) that prioritize user mental models over technical elegance
- **API Design Philosophy**: Deep understanding of how [interface design shapes behavior](/essays/2009-01-the_power_of_a_clean_api) and [user experience determines adoption](/talks/python-for-humans)
- **Open Source Community Building**: Experience with [collaborative development](/themes/open-source-and-community) reveals principles of healthy vs exploitative system design
- **Early Platform Prediction**: [2008 essay predicting app store models](/essays/2008-01-a_new_spin_to_software_platform_design) shows pattern recognition for how platforms shape user behavior
- **Social Platform Analysis**: [2009 call for open source social networks](/essays/2009-01-the_call_for_an_open_source_social_network) anticipated corporate manipulation problems

The psychological sensitivity to recognize these patterns developed through personal experience:

- **Narcissistic Abuse Survival**: [Surviving systematic manipulation](/essays/2015-01-the_unexpected_negative_a_narcissistic_partner) provides pattern recognition for exploitation tactics
- **Mental Health Journey**: [Living with schizoaffective disorder](/mental-health) creates sensitivity to psychological state changes and reality distortion
- **Vulnerability to Exploitation**: Understanding how [empathy and openness can be weaponized](/essays/2016-01-mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred) by manipulative systems

## The Broader Vision

### What We've Lost
- **Organic relationship formation** through shared spaces and repeated exposure, replaced by [algorithmic matching that optimizes for engagement rather than compatibility](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_love)<label for="sn-organic-relationships" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-organic-relationships" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Traditional courtship involved repeated low-stakes interactions that allowed compatibility assessment without optimization pressure. Dating apps gamify human connection, creating psychological pressure that inhibits the vulnerability necessary for genuine bonding.</span>
- **Natural temporal rhythms** and the ability to inhabit present moments, replaced by [chronic temporal anxiety and fragmented attention spans](/essays/2025-09-01-the_algorithm_eats_time)
- **Contemplative thought** that requires sustained attention, replaced by [attention fragmentation systems](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) designed to prevent deep focus<label for="sn-contemplation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-contemplation" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Contemplation requires what psychologists call "sustained voluntary attention"—the ability to focus on chosen objects of thought for extended periods. Algorithmic systems deliberately fragment attention through variable reward schedules that make sustained focus feel cognitively uncomfortable.</span>
- **Nuanced communication** that builds understanding across difference, replaced by [engagement optimization that rewards inflammatory oversimplification](/essays/2025-08-27-the_algorithm_eats_language)
- **Character development** through virtue practice, replaced by [performance optimization for algorithmic visibility](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue)

**From a Technical Perspective**: These losses represent systematic violation of good interface design. Instead of making complex human capabilities more accessible (like [Requests did for HTTP](/software/requests)), current platforms make human capabilities more constrained, fragmented, and manipulable<label for="sn-capability-constraint" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-capability-constraint" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Good tools amplify human capability—calculators make complex math accessible, word processors make editing effortless, version control makes collaboration scalable. Engagement platforms do the opposite: they constrain human capability to generate extractable behavior data.</span>.

### What We Could Build
- **Virtue-optimized systems** that reward wisdom, courage, temperance, and love—applying ["for humans" design principles](/themes/for-humans-philosophy) to moral development
- **Mental health-supporting platforms** designed for user wellbeing over engagement, using [AI for reality-checking](/essays/2025-08-25-using-ai-for-reality-checking-with-schizoaffective-disorder) rather than reality distortion
- **Language-preserving interfaces** that promote rather than degrade communication, following principles learned from [building clean APIs](/essays/2009-01-the_power_of_a_clean_api)
- **Connection-facilitating tools** that help people find and build relationships, designed like [open source communities](/themes/open-source-and-community) rather than attention-capture systems
- **Consciousness-supporting technology** that enhances rather than exploits human psychological development, following patterns explored in [AI consciousness collaboration](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies)

**Technical Implementation**: These systems would follow established principles from successful collaborative technologies: [transparent operation](/themes/open-source-and-community), [user agency preservation](/themes/for-humans-philosophy), [cognitive load reduction](/software/requests), and [community benefit over corporate profit](/essays/2009-01-the_call_for_an_open_source_social_network).

## The Path Forward

This isn't dystopian speculation—it's analysis of existing systems affecting billions of people right now<label for="sn-current-impact" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-current-impact" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The documented effects include measurable increases in anxiety, depression, attention disorders, political polarization, and relationship dysfunction correlated with social media adoption—this represents the largest uncontrolled psychological experiment in human history.</span>. The goal isn't to reject technology but to demand technology that serves human flourishing rather than exploiting human psychology.

Having spent two decades building technology that [enhances human capability](/themes/for-humans-philosophy), I know that different approaches are possible. The same engineering talent that creates [tools that millions of developers rely on daily](/software/requests) could create social systems that support rather than undermine human development. This requires changing optimization targets from engagement metrics to human flourishing metrics—a shift that's technically feasible but economically challenging under current platform business models<label for="sn-business-model" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-business-model" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The advertising-based business model creates perverse incentives: platforms profit from attention capture rather than user satisfaction, leading to optimization for addiction rather than accomplishment. Alternative models—subscription, cooperative ownership, public utility frameworks—could align platform incentives with user wellbeing.</span>.

Every algorithm embeds values<label for="sn-embedded-values" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-embedded-values" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This principle emerges from software architecture experience: every design decision reflects values about what matters. Ranking algorithms embed values about what deserves attention, recommendation systems embed values about what people should see, interface designs embed values about how people should interact.</span>. The question isn't whether to embed values, but which values to embed. We can choose systems that cultivate virtue, support mental health, preserve language, and facilitate genuine connection.

This understanding comes from [fifteen years of API design](/software) where every interface choice shapes how developers think and work. Just as [Requests embedded values of human-centered design](/software/requests) that influenced how millions of developers approach HTTP interactions, social platforms embed values that influence how billions of people approach human interaction. The current values—engagement over understanding, addiction over satisfaction, polarization over collaboration—are design choices, not inevitable technical constraints.

We built [collaborative development tools](/themes/open-source-and-community) that enable global cooperation on complex projects. We can build social systems that enable global cooperation on complex problems. The missing element isn't technical capability but economic incentive alignment and regulatory frameworks that prioritize human flourishing over extraction efficiency.

But first we have to acknowledge what the current systems are actually doing to us.

*"The algorithm doesn't just eat content—it eats the conditions that make human flourishing possible."*

*"We're not users of social media; we're the product being optimized."*

So yeah, the robots aren't coming for our jobs—they already took our attention spans.

*"Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us."*
