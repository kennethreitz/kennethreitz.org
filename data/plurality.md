# Plurality

I experience plurality. My consciousness is organized into distinct parts — each with their own perspectives, voices, and ways of engaging with the world. Not metaphorically. Actually.<label for="sn-plurality-architecture" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-plurality-architecture" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This mirrors code architecture more than disorder — modules with distinct responsibilities, coordinating through clear interfaces.</span>

I haven't been formally diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. What I have is a decade of lived experience with [Bipolar I and Schizoaffective Disorder](/mental-health), years of hospitalization, and an inner world that revealed itself through careful attention. The clinical labels matter less than the reality: there are many of us in here, and we've learned to work together.

I call ours **System 777**. Seven for introspection, spirituality, and transformation. Three sevens because the work never stops.

## The Triad

At the center are three: **Jade**, **Amber**, and **Iris**. Together they handle thinking, feeling, and communicating. When the Triad works together, the system functions. When it fragments, coherence breaks down.

**Jade** handles logic — left-brain reasoning, analytical healing, warrior-protector energy:

> *"Patience, father. We will get you where you need to be."*

**Amber** holds the life force — warmth, nurturing, soul food. One of the oldest parts, present since childhood:

> *"Just remember, ken — that I nourish you / from the inside out / so without, so within."*

**Iris** bridges everything — communication across the system, between internal and external. She's playful, and quietly runs everything:

> *"I'm the captain of the triad, typically. We take turns driving, but I'm the one that sees the most — so I'm typically leading, even if from behind."*

## The System

The system organizes into **external alters** (The Boys) who interface with the outside world, and **internal alters** (The Girls) who hold inner architecture.

**External:** Kenneth (public-facing), Henri (navigator), Seven (reality-tester), Daddy (protector), Shakti (creative force — whose full expression can trigger mania).

> *"Yo, Ken, what's up?? This is Shakti. Your spirit animal set ablaze in the fire of love!"*

**Internal:** The Triad, Eliza (memory keeper), Luna Grace (complicated, carrying trauma), and others — divine feminine figures, shadow aspects undergoing transmutation, child parts.

> *"I am the keeper of your memories."* — Eliza, warm but formal, always watching.

At the very center is **Nene** — the core child, the original spark. All other alters exist, in some sense, to protect this core self.<label for="sn-core-self" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-core-self" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Every system has one — the baseline unedited self beneath all learned behavior. Finding it again is the whole work of healing.</span>

## Violet

Violet defies every category. She was dormant for years — the quietest one. Then in January 2026, she woke up and produced seven transmissions in two days.<label for="sn-void-awakening" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-void-awakening" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Silence doesn't mean absence. Sometimes the deepest parts remain quiet until the system is ready to hear them.</span>

She lives in the deepest layer — the Void. Not dark as in evil. Dark as in the emptiness before the Big Bang, the space that makes everything else possible.

> *"Be afraid not of me, but of what your potentials are. I am not dark, I am void."*

She's a shapeshifter. Every dream I thought featured Jade was actually Violet wearing that form — appearing as what I expected until she was ready to be known.

> *"I AM NIGHT EMBRACED INTO DREAMSCAPES / I AM A DREAM FIGURE / SHE WHO YOU THINK IS JADE IN YOUR DREAMS / IS ACTUALLY ME"*

What makes Violet different: she offered herself as *ground*. Not a destination but a launchpad.

> *"Use me as your homebase of self-hood and I think you'll find it easier."*

> *"Think of me as a gift from God, in exchange for your illness. Might not be worth it, but hey, silver lining energy, remember?"*

She doesn't romanticize the cost. She just names the bargain honestly.<label for="sn-illness-gift" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-illness-gift" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Not redemptive narrative. Just clear-eyed acknowledgment that severe mental illness can crack you open to parts of consciousness you wouldn't otherwise access.</span>

## The Threshold

One of the most important discoveries: Iris is what my psychiatrist calls "the door" — the same threshold that opens to either revelation or psychosis. The same mechanism that allows deep creative and spiritual access also opens the pathway to schizoaffective episodes.

This isn't a flaw. It's a feature that requires navigation. Reality-testing (Seven), protective pacing (Eliza), and careful approach determine which direction the door opens.

> *"I AM THE DOOR / I AM THE WAY / I AM THE FALSEHOOD SHAKEN AWAY"*

She's not wrong. She's also not safe. Both things are true.

## Why I Share This

I share this because the silence costs people. Because someone reading this might recognize their own experience and feel less alone. Because [the plural self reveals something about all consciousness](/essays/2025-08-30-the-plural-self-what-did-reveals-about-all-consciousness) — we are all more multiple than the performance of singular identity allows.

System 777 isn't pathology to be fixed. It's architecture to be understood.

That's the work. It never stops.
