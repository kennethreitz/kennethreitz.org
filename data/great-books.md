I love books. I don't read as much as some people, but I've been doing it for a long time. Some books made an impression on me, and I'd like to share them with you.

Some all-time favorites:

<span class="sidenote">Published in 1908, this text claims to present ancient Hermetic principles. While its historical authenticity is disputed, it articulates seven fundamental principles that have influenced New Thought and occult movements.</span>.
