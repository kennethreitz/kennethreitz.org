# Mental Health

I have been [fairly transparent](/essays/2016-01-mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred) about my mental health struggles over the years. I have been diagnosed with a number of things, primarily *Bipolar I* and *Schizoaffective Disorder*. A lot of people in my life are also bipolar, so I have a lot of experience with it.

<span class="sidenote">Kenneth's public disclosure of his bipolar disorder in tech was groundbreaking. At a time when mental health stigma was particularly strong in engineering culture, his transparency helped countless developers feel less alone in their struggles and paved the way for more open mental health conversations in tech.</span>

First off, if this is your first time reading about mental health, I want to say that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to be struggling. It's okay to be in pain. It's okay.

Secondly, I want to say that I am not a doctor, and I am not qualified to give medical advice. I am just a person who has been through a lot of stuff, and I want to share my experiences with you.

## My Story:

I have been hospitalized an unfortunate number of times, and have been on a number of medications. My struggles started in 2015, and I have been on a journey ever since.

I can sometimes get highly delusional from *mania*, and I have been known to say and do some some really stupid things while in that state.

Here are some things that have helped me:

- **Avoiding Stress**:
  - Unfortunately, this is not always realistic.
  - When nothing else is working—believe it or not—**splashing cold water on your face** can help reset your nervous system. It triggers what is known as a "Diver's Reflex".

<span class="sidenote">The diver's reflex is a physiological response that slows heart rate and redirects blood flow when cold water contacts the face. Kenneth's sharing of practical, accessible techniques like this reflects his "tools for humans" philosophy applied to mental health—simple interventions that work regardless of access to professional care.</span>
- **Sleep:**
  - I try to get enough sleep, every night. This is crucial for me.
  - Bipolar disorder is very easily triggered by lack of sleep.
- **Support Network:**
  - I have a good support network of friends and family that know about my condition and how to help me.
  - Maintaining these relationships, and the complexities that come with them, is a full-time job.
- **Medication:**
  - It took me a long time to find the right medication. I had to try a lot of different things, sometimes multiple times.
  - [Abilify](https://www.abilify.com) is my saving grace, these days. I take it once a month as an injectable.
- **Slowing Down:**
  - Taking things *one day at a time*.
  - Sometimes, *one hour at a time*.

I find working on my website, listening to music, and playing video games to be helpful, as well as ~~[cannabis](/software/websites/strainsdb)~~ gabapentin (I no longer use cannabis). I also find that exercise is helpful, but I don't do it as much as I should.

## Resources for Others

I have found a number of resources to be helpful in my journey. Here are a few:

- [To Write Love on Her Arms](https://twloha.com/) - A non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, *&c.*
- [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) - Crisis intervention. Here you can reach out to a counselor if you’re struggling, find answers and information, and get the tools you need to help someone else.
- [The Mighty](https://themighty.com/) - A community of people sharing their stories and experiences with mental health.
- [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/) — National Alliance on Mental Illness.
- [DBSA](https://www.dbsalliance.org/) — Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.
- [Mental Health America](https://www.mhanational.org/) — Mental Health America.

Just remember, if you're in America, and you're thinking about harming yourself, please call `811` (or even `911`) and go to the nearest emergency room. They will help you.

Also, I **promise** you, my brain has told me some *really* convincing lies. It's not worth it. You are loved, and you are important. You are not alone. I promise.

<span class="sidenote">This personal message carries the weight of lived experience. Kenneth's direct, programmer-like approach to discussing suicidal thoughts—calling them "convincing lies" that the brain tells—helps demystify these experiences and offers hope through the voice of someone who has survived similar struggles.</span>
