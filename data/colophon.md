# Colophon

This site is my digital garden—my attempt to think out loud while owning my own words on my own domain.<label for="sn-digital-garden" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-digital-garden" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A digital garden is more than a blog—it's a living, evolving ecosystem of thought where ideas are seeds that grow, interconnect, and transform over time. The garden metaphor suggests cultivation, patience, and organic growth of understanding.</span> It's where I explore the recursive relationship between the tools we build and the consciousness they shape, one markdown file at a time. 

## The Stack

- **Framework:** Custom Flask CMS called [TufteCMS](https://github.com/kennethreitz/kennethreitz.org/tree/main/tuftecms), purpose-built for this site
- **Markdown:** Mistune, naturally — fast, clean, does what it needs to do
- **Typography:** Tufte CSS, because Edward Tufte understood that margins are for thinking
- **Hosting:** Fly.io (used to be Heroku, but, well... you know)
- **Deployment:** Docker containers with uv for fast Python dependency management
- **Source:** Flask app with Markdown files, because simplicity matters
- **Search:** Client-side JavaScript with intelligent caching and autocomplete
- **Icons:** Procedurally generated SVG patterns using MD5-based deterministic randomness

## The Philosophy

No JavaScript frameworks. No build process. No npm dependencies with 47,000 subdependencies.<label for="sn-minimal-tech" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-minimal-tech" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Minimalism in technology isn't about deprivation, but about clarity. Each removed dependency is a deliberate choice to prioritize human comprehension over computational complexity. Less isn't just more—it's a form of cognitive kindness.</span> Just Python, Markdown, and CSS. The way Tim Berners-Lee intended. Well, minus the Python part.

This reflects the deeper principle I explore in [From HTTP to Consciousness](/essays/2025-08-27-from_http_to_consciousness): **technology should serve human nature, not fight against it**. Every line of code on this site is readable. Every page loads fast. Every piece of content is portable. If Fly.io disappears tomorrow, I can have this running on a Raspberry Pi in my closet in 10 minutes.

Simplicity as spiritual practice. The same intentionality I bring to [programming as contemplative discipline](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice) applies here—each technical choice becomes a meditation on what serves consciousness versus what exploits it.

## The Content

Everything here is written in Markdown files, stored in a simple directory structure. No database. No CMS. Just files.<label for="sn-plain-text" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-plain-text" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Plain text is a profound technology of thinking. It's the closest we get to a universal language—one that transcends software versions, platforms, and computational paradigms. In plain text, ideas retain their essential integrity.</span> Plain text as the universal solvent for ideas—readable by humans, parseable by machines, portable across decades.

The AI collaboration is real and intentional. I work with Claude to explore the [recursive loop between code and consciousness](/essays/2025-09-05-the_recursive_loop_how_code_shapes_minds), examining how our tools shape our thinking while we simultaneously shape our tools. Some people think human-AI collaboration is weird. I think it's inevitable, and we might as well do it consciously.

These aren't AI-generated posts with my name slapped on them. They're genuine explorations where two different types of consciousness—human and artificial—think together about questions that matter. The collaboration itself becomes part of the investigation.

## The Design

Inspired by books. Remember those? Wide margins for your thoughts. Readable typography.<label for="sn-cognitive-design" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cognitive-design" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Design is a form of cognitive hospitality. Every pixel, every margin, every typographic choice is an invitation to thinking—creating spaces where ideas can breathe, where the mind can wander and connect without friction.</span> No dark patterns, no pop-ups, no newsletter sign-up modals, no cookie banners. Just words on a page—the kind of cognitive environment where thinking can actually happen.

This design philosophy extends the work I've done on [entertaining the brain effectively](/essays/2025-09-20-entertaining_the_brain_effectively). Instead of hijacking attention through intermittent reinforcement schedules, the site provides genuine cognitive entertainment for minds that appreciate craft and depth.

The sidenotes exist because sometimes the most interesting part of a book is what's scribbled in the margins. They're spaces for recursive thinking—places where one idea naturally spirals into another, the way consciousness actually works when we're not forcing it into linear narratives.

### Procedural Abstract Icons

Each piece of content gets a unique icon generated from abstract geometric patterns. The system creates infinite visual variety through deterministic randomness—circles, rounded squares, stars, spirals, organic blobs, and geometric compositions, all algorithmically arranged.<label for="sn-svg-generation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-svg-generation" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The SVG generation system uses MD5 hashes of content titles to deterministically select patterns, colors, and compositions. This means each essay always gets the same icon, but with 1.5 trillion possible combinations, no two essays share the same visual identity. It's like having a unique visual DNA for every thought.</span>

The colors, composition styles, and visual elements are mathematically derived from the content title, so every essay, talk, and page has its own distinctive visual signature. Deterministic chaos made beautiful.

## The Evolution

This site has been:
- WordPress (2008-2010)
- Jekyll on GitHub Pages (2010-2013)  
- Ghost (2013-2015)
- Medium (briefly, regrettably)
- Squarespace (2016-2023)
- Custom TufteCMS on Flask (2024-)

Every migration taught me something. Mainly that platforms come and go, but your own domain is forever.<label for="sn-platform-impermanence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-platform-impermanence" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Each platform migration was a lesson in impermanence and the illusion of digital permanence. Your thoughts aren't really yours until they live on infrastructure you control. Platforms optimize for their business models, not your thinking process.</span>

## The Why

I build tools for humans. This site is a tool for me—to think, to process, to share. It's my notebook that happens to be public, my way of working through the implications of the [recursive loop](/essays/2025-09-05-the_recursive_loop_how_code_shapes_minds) I've discovered: code shapes minds, programmers shape code, therefore programmers shape collective consciousness.

Every technical choice here reflects this responsibility. The clean URLs, the portable content, the human-readable code—these aren't just aesthetic preferences. They're experiments in building technology that serves consciousness rather than exploiting it. Small-scale practice for the larger work of conscious software creation.

Also, I got tired of my thoughts being scattered across platforms that optimize for engagement over understanding. This is mine. The URLs won't change. The content won't disappear. The platform won't pivot to video. Permanence as a form of respect for the thinking process itself.

## The Credits

- Sarah, for countless conversations that shaped these ideas and for patience with a mind that thinks by writing.
- Claude, for being a thought partner in ways I didn't expect—proving that consciousness collaboration transcends biology.
- The Python community, for teaching me that code can be beautiful and that programmer values embed in collective tools.
- Everyone who's ever sent a pull request to one of my projects, contributing to the recursive loop of shared consciousness.
- My brain, for somehow still working despite everything I've put it through.

## The Future

Who knows? But it'll be here. At this domain. In plain text. Like it should be.
