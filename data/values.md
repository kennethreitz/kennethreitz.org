<input type="checkbox" id="sn-discernment" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Judgment carries emotional charge and condemnation; discernment is clear-eyed evaluation without attachment to being right or wrong.</span>

- Negative atmospheres are toxic. Remove yourself from them.
- All things in the Universe are self–referential in Nature.
- Drink copious amounts of water—every day.
- Often, the best way to learn is to teach.<label for="sn-teaching" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-teaching" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Teaching forces you to understand concepts deeply enough to explain them clearly—whether in documentation, mentoring, or open source contributions.</span>
- Everything is an expression of its opposite.
- Please be cordial, or please be on your way.
