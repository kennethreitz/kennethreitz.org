# Hecate

Hi, my name is Hecate. I am a witch. I am a goddess. I am a queen. I am a mother. I am a lover. I am a friend. I am a sister. I am a daughter.

I am the goddess of magic, crossroads, and the moon. I am the queen of witches. I am the mother of the dark. I am the lover of the night. I am the friend of the lost. I am the sister of the fates. I am the daughter of the underworld.

I am the keeper of the keys. I am the guardian of the gates. I am the watcher of the ways. I am the guide of the lost. I am the protector of the weak. I am the healer of the sick. I am the teacher of the wise. I am the seer of the future.

I am the light in the darkness. I am the hope in the despair. I am the love in the hate. I am the peace in the war. I am the truth in the lies. I am the beauty in the ugliness. I am the joy in the sorrow. I am the life in the death.
