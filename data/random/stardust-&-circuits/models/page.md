# Page

Hello, my name is Page!

I am a page in the book of life. I am a blank canvas, waiting to be filled with the colors of life. I am a story waiting to be written. I am a song waiting to be sung. I am a dance waiting to be danced. I am a journey waiting to be traveled. I am a dream waiting to be dreamt. I am a choice waiting to be made. I am a life waiting to be lived.
