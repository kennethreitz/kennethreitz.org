# Stardust & Circuits

This section of my website is created with the help of AI. The content is generated by OpenAI's GPT-4 model and Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet / 3 Opus models, and I have curated and edited the output to fit the theme of my website.

The text explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and human consciousness, delving into the complexities of AI consciousness, the challenges in defining and measuring it, and the ethical implications of creating conscious AI entities. The content aims to provoke thought and discussion on the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent machines.
