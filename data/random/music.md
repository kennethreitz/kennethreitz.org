# On Music

I love music. I listen to it all the time. I play it all the time.

My music client of choice is [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com), mostly because
of seamless integration with my devices, as well as the lossless quality that
is a big deal for me.

## Favorite Artists

I listen to a lot of hip-hop and rock, mostly. As I get older, I'm finding
that I'm listening to more and more electronic music, as well. The energy
of rock is more taxing to my ears, I've noticed, as I age.
