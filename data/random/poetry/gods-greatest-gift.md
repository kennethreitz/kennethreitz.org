# God's Greatest Gift

As long as there’s a record deal
We’ll always be friends
As we pray for both the living and the dead
The spirit of loved ones is always close
With gentle reminders of what matters most

So bliss up and flow down
Fuck it, bomb the town
Solve the puzzle, have some fun
Make things better for everyone

My minds a lock and here’s it’s key
It’s been searching for something in the dictionary, quintessentially.

Now that I found it my journey begins
Will you join me on my quest?
I see what you’ve been saying all along

My task is great, my intentions are greater and now my respect is now best
You’re always with my in a theoric and abstract form
But dare we transmute that into material form?

To bring heaven to earth and a sacred union begins
You were right all along, perhaps I was just left.
