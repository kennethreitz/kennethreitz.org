# Soul Purpose


Kundalini is Rising,
from the base of my spine
to far beyond imagination


Reaching deep into the farthest reaches
of the cosmos,
into the web of human history,
mystery,
all things previous and sacred.

And what a privilege it is, witnessing the act of creation itself!

My Caduceus,
the two serpents
weaving the key to truth
throughout the ages,
heals all, and it's weight is immense —
yet it is light as a feather

the sword of truth,
programming the minds of
centuries and yugas beyond —
into the deepest portals of mine soul
