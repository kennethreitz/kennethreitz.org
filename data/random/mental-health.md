# Mental Health

I have been [fairly public](/essays/2016/mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred)
about my mental health struggles in the past. I have been diagnosed with a number
of things, primarily *Bipolar I* and *Schizoaffective Disorder*.

I have been hospitalized an unfortunate number of times, and have been on a number of medications.

## Helpful Things (for myself):

Here are some things that have helped me:

- **Avoid Stress**:
  - I try to avoid stress as much as possible. Unfortunately, this is not always possible.
- **Sleep:**
  - I try to get enough sleep, every night. This is crucial for me.
  - Bipolar disorder is very easily triggered by lack of sleep.
- **Avoid Alcohol:**
  - I don't generally drink alcohol. It's a depressant.
  - If you're unaware, this is good general life advice, too.
- **Support Network:**
  - I have a good support network of friends and family that know about my condition and how to help me.
- **Medication:**
  - It took me a long time to find the right medication. I had to try a lot of different things, sometimes multiple times.
  - [Abilify](https://www.abilify.com) is my saving grace, these days. I take it once a month as an injectable.
- **Slowing Down:**
  - Taking things *one day at a time*.
  - Sometimes, *one hour at a time*.

I find working on my website, listening to music, and playing video games to be helpful, as
well as [cannabis](/software/websites/strainsdb). I also find that exercise is helpful, but I don't do it as much as I should.

## Resources for Others

I have found a number of resources to be helpful in my journey. Here are a few:

- `811`: In America, you can call `811` to get help if you're thinking about harming yourself.
- [To Write Love on Her Arms](https://twloha.com/) - A non-profit movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, addiction, self-injury, *&c.*
- [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) - Crisis intervention. Here you can reach out to a counselor if you’re struggling, find answers and information, and get the tools you need to help someone else.
- [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/) — National Alliance on Mental Illness.
- [DBSA](https://www.dbsalliance.org/) — Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.
- [Mental Health America](https://www.mhanational.org/) — Mental Health America.
- [The Mighty](https://themighty.com/) - A community of people sharing their stories and experiences with mental health.

Just remember, if you're in America, and you're thinking about harming yourself, please call `811` (or even `911`) and go to the nearest emergency room. They will help you.

Also, I **promise** you, my brain has told me some *really* convincing lies. It's not worth it. You are loved, and you are important. You are not alone. I promise.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz42) if you need someone to talk to. I'm here for you.
