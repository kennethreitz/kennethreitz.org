# Mental Health

I have been [fairly transparent](/essays/2016/mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred) about my mental health struggles over the years. I have been diagnosed with a number of things, primarily *Bipolar I* and *Schizoaffective Disorder*. A lot of people in my life are also bipolar, so I have a lot of experience with it.

First off, if this is your first time reading about mental health, I want to say that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to be struggling. It's okay to be in pain. It's okay.

- [The Reality of Developer Burnout](/essays/2017/the_reality_of_developer_burnout)

Secondly, I want to say that I am not a doctor, and I am not qualified to give medical advice. I am just a person who has been through a lot of stuff, and I want to share my experiences with you.

## My Story:

I have been hospitalized an unfortunate number of times, and have been on a number of medications. My struggles started in 2015, and I have been on a journey ever since.

I can sometimes get highly delusional from *mania*, and I have been known to say and do some some really stupid things while in that state.

Here are some things that have helped me:

- **Avoiding Stress**:
  - Unfortunately, this is not always realistic.
  - When nothing else is working—believe it or not—**splashing cold water on your face** can help reset your nervous system. It triggers what is known as a "Diver's Reflex".
- **Sleep:**
  - I try to get enough sleep, every night. This is crucial for me.
  - Bipolar disorder is very easily triggered by lack of sleep.
- **Support Network:**
  - I have a good support network of friends and family that know about my condition and how to help me.
  - Maintaining these relationships, and the complexities that come with them, is a full-time job.
- **Medication:**
  - It took me a long time to find the right medication. I had to try a lot of different things, sometimes multiple times.
  - [Abilify](https://www.abilify.com) is my saving grace, these days. I take it once a month as an injectable.
- **Slowing Down:**
  - Taking things *one day at a time*.
  - Sometimes, *one hour at a time*.

I find working on my website, listening to music, and playing video games to be helpful, as well as [cannabis](/software/websites/strainsdb). I also find that exercise is helpful, but I don't do it as much as I should.

## Resources for Others

I have found a number of resources to be helpful in my journey. Here are a few:

Just remember, if you're in America, and you're thinking about harming yourself, please call `811` (or even `911`) and go to the nearest emergency room. They will help you.

Also, I **promise** you, my brain has told me some *really* convincing lies. It's not worth it. You are loved, and you are important. You are not alone. I promise.
