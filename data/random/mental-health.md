# Mental Health

I have been [fairly public](/essays/2016/mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred)
about my mental health struggles in the past. I have been diagnosed with a number
of things, primarily **Bipolar I**.

I have been hospitalized an unfortunate number of times, and have been on a number of medications.

## Helpful Things

Here are some things that have helped me:

- **Sleep:** I try to get enough sleep, every night. This is crucial for me.
  - Bipolar disorder is very easily triggered by lack of sleep.
- **Avoid Alcohol:** I don't drink alcohol. It's a depressant.
  - Generally good life advice, too.
- **Support Network:** I have a good support network of friends and family.
  - All things in balance :)
- **Medication:** I take medication every day. It helps me a lot.
  - It took me a long time to find the right medication. I had to try a lot of different things, sometimes multiple times.
- Taking things *one day at a time*.

I find working on my website, listening to music, and playing video games to be helpful, as
well as [cannabis](/software/websites/strainsdb). I also find that exercise is helpful, but I don't do it as much as I should.

## Resources for Others
