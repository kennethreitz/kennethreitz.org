# Yoga & Meditation

Yoga (which means *union*) is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga, consisting largely of the postures called asanas.

I use the term *vedic* to encapsulate these various philosophies and understandings of the Eastern spiritual traditions. I find that the term *vedic* is a more accurate and respectful term to use when discussing these practices, as it is a term that is used by the practitioners themselves.

## Misappropriation of Yoga

You can see the misappropriation of these practices in the Western world in the form of "yoga pants" and "yoga mats." These are not yoga, but rather the physical practice of yoga, which is only one small part of the larger spiritual tradition.

## Meditation

Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Vedas, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Hinduism and Buddhism.

**It is not universally good practice** to meditate. Meditation can be harmful to individuals with certain mental health conditions, such as PTSD or anxiety disorders. It is important to consult with a mental health professional before beginning a meditation practice.
