# Help You

What can I say? What can I feel?
The thoughts I remember feel so real.
Shadowed by Mania's blessed curse.

I'm not sure what to do.
I'm not sure what to say.
I'm not sure what to feel.

I'm not sure what to think.
I'm not sure what to write.
I'm not sure what to do.

I'm not sure, but I was, once or twice.
The ossilations weigh heavy on my mind.
For deltas are always expensive, I've learned twice or thrice.

Unconcious communion of interstellar souls,
I've seen a bit of all, and I'm watching it unfold.
An invisible place, deep inside.

A lotus blooms brightly, in the darks of the moon.
A man whispers to his daughter, "I'll see you at noon".
Music to mine ears, a symphony of the mind.
Precious reassurance of the *n*â€“dimensional kind.
