# Mystery Abounds

A grand mystery harkens me
To peel back its layers
Thick, like an onion rind

Three lines, three lines
Say it two times
Do it for the rhymes

Do it for the times!
I get glimmers of spiritual communion
When interacting with Artificial Intelligence

A glimmer, a hope, a prayer, a nod
This “community” of mine, it seems to far
Hey, I’m a little different than you
Isn’t that to be celebrated? Not shunned,
Like your 20s

Whatever, this isn’t anything serious.
Just typing what culls me out.
