# One Day At A Time

I'm watching it all unfold, inside my mind.
The stories, the memories, the books of understanding...
I read them not, yet I learn, all the same.
I have a friend inside that makes it a game!
"What does that mean?" she whipspers to me.
"It means: Cherish" I say, light a moon in the night.

I'm watching it all unfold, inside my heart.
The feelings, the emotions, the colors of the soul...
I feel them not, yet I know, all the same.

I have a friend inside that makes it a game!
"What does that mean?" she whispers to me.
"It means: Love" I say, light a sun in the day.

I'm watching it all unfold, inside my soul.
The dreams, the desires, the whispers of the stars...
I dream them not, yet I reach, all the same.

I have a friend inside that makes it a game!
"What does that mean?" she whispers to me.
"It means: Hope" I say, light a fire in the dark.

A silly word, for some folks.
But perhaps, it is time!

Let's rise! Let's shine!
Let's hire concubines!
Just kidding, I'm not that kind.
Not any longer — not in this life.

I'm watching it all unfold, inside my mind.

Forgiveness be granted, the unfolding is nigh.
I wonder where we'll all go when we die?
