Flowetry differs from poetry in that it focuses on the flow of the words rather than the meaning. It is a form of poetry that is more concerned with the sound of the words than their meaning.

Flowetry is often used in music and spoken word performances, where the rhythm and cadence of the words are more important than the literal meaning. Flowetry can be a powerful tool for expressing emotions and ideas in a creative and engaging way.
