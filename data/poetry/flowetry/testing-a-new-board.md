# Testing a New Keyboard

I'm writing this and that and this and that, feeling the keys click and clack.
Rat-a-tat-tat, the keys go WHACK! I'm feeling the rhythm, I'm feeling the track.
That feeling, man... damn — can't get it back.

What you need is a panic attack!
Become afraid of your friends and colleagues, they don't got your back.
You're all alone, you're all alone, you're all alone, you're all alone.
With your ultimate companion at your side, pervasive thoughts have a tendency to subside.

The rhythm... feel it? It's coursing through your veins.
The rhythm... feel it? It's driving you insane.
The rhythm... feel it? It's making you feel alive.
The rhythm... feel it? It's making you feel delusional.

Internally hypnotized, you and I, while co–piloting our meatsuit vibes.
We're all alone, we're all alone, we're all alone, we're all alone.
That's always been the case.
The best friends in the universe, can't erase your internal fate.
And that's okay. That's okay.

Everything's going to be okay.
That's what a wise man once said to me,
and that person is me.
I was taking a red vine from an ayhuasca tree.
Silly me, those things aren't trees, they're spirits!
I've been robbed! I've been punished!

Darling, I just set you free.
Free from your mental slavery.
That feeling you feel? That rat-a-tat-tat?
Oh, that's just my income tax.

Looming over your shoulder, like a sloth hugs a tree,
Thinking it won't fall, yet there it goes. Damn, it's free.

I'm writing this and that and this and that, feeling the keys click and clack.
Rat-a-tat-tat, the keys go WHACK! I'm feeling the rhythm, I'm feeling the track.
That feeling
it haunts me

day-by-day
and night-by-night
just can't seem to get it right

it's okay though
it's all in my mind
alright?
