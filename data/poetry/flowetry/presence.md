# Presence

Kanye said it best,
So I'll say it next.
My presence is a present
So I present to you my best.

I'm here, I'm there, I'm manic sometimes.
Especially when writing truthful rhymes.
A missing syllable there; a missing rhyme here, laid bare.
I'm not perfect, but I'm here — are you there???

I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere.
I'm in your heart, I'm in your hair.
I'm in your mind, I'm in your soul.

Who is me?
We'll never know.
