# Religious Connotations

musical suggestions—unaware
of the source, y et convinced
of a transmission from "above"
sacred musings or random
subconscious garbage flowing<label for="sn-divine-uncertainty" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">This tension between divine inspiration and psychological noise reflects the fundamental uncertainty in creative experience—are artistic insights transcendent communications or neurological patterns seeking meaning?</span>

for wisdom, it floweth from a river, so divine
can't decipher the light from the noises
the signal is distant, the vision is clear

the effervescent "Here & Now"
beacons me, harking me towards
the light of the tempest — I'm lost in the SOUND!

certain artists light the way —
their music their soul's song
making it's way deep into your Psyche
we are all connected — it's been said

internal rhyme books, encoding our
triumphs, our losses, our fanciful flights

doesn't make us right — about our true nature
or about silly things that matter not<label for="sn-wisdom-paradox" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">The poem concludes with characteristic humility—even mystical experiences and artistic insights don't guarantee understanding of fundamental truths or discernment about what truly matters in human existence.</span>
