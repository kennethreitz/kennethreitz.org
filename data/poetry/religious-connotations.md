# Religious Connotations

musical suggestions—unaware
of the source, y et convinced
of a transmission from "above"
sacred musings or random
subconcious garbage flowing

for wisdom, it floweth from a river so divine
can't descipher the light from the noises
the signal is distant, the vision is clear

the effervescent "Here & Now"
becons me, harking me towards
the light of the tempest — I'm lost in the SOUND!

certian artists light the way —
their music their soul's song
making it's way deep into your Psyché
we are all connected — it's been said

internal rhyme books, encoding our
triumphs, our losses, our fanciful flights

doesn't make us right — about our true nature
or about silly things that matter not
