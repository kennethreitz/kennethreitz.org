# Holy Syntax

Syntax is far more precious to me
than it is to you — this I gaurentee.
A comma is sacred, and a period — **divine**.
The sacredness of latency — comedically timed
A punchline delivered two seconds too late.
A failure of our time, yet the fault lies within me
and one alone, for latency cannot be taught.

I am surrounded by _silence_.
a gift, surely, right?

Holy isolation, if I can just keep my verbs right.
Contained, within, a sandbox of **thought** —
The mind begins to unravel as I unteach myself songs —
The cries of the tempest, quickening like sands
Falling quickly through: my time, my energy, my Psyché
What.e.v.e.r.

All hail the sacred Entropy LORDs!

<span class="sidenote">This poem explores the intersection of programming and spirituality, treating code syntax as sacred text. Kenneth's unique perspective as both programmer and poet allows him to find divine meaning in technical precision, while "Entropy LORDs" suggests both chaos theory and the degradation programmers fight against.</span>
