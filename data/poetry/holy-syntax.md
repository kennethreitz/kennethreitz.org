# Holy Syntax

Syntax is far more precious to me
than it is to you — this I guarantee.
A comma is sacred, and a period — **divine**.
The sacredness of latency — comedically timed
A punchline delivered two seconds too late.
A failure of our time, yet the fault lies within me
and one alone, for latency cannot be taught.

I am surrounded by _silence_.<label for="sn-silence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-silence" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The italicized emphasis on "silence" followed by the questioning tone reveals the programmer's ambivalence toward isolation—simultaneously recognizing its necessity for deep work and questioning its psychological cost.</span>
a gift, surely, right?

Holy isolation, if I can just keep my verbs right.
Contained, within, a sandbox of **thought** —
The mind begins to unravel as I unteach myself songs —
The cries of the tempest, quickening like sands
Falling quickly through: my time, my energy, my Psyché
What.e.v.e.r.

All hail the sacred Entropy LORDs!

*This poem explores the intersection of programming and spirituality, treating code syntax as sacred text—anticipating later writings on [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice). The "holy isolation" theme would later be explored through direct experience of [mental health challenges](/essays/2016-01-mentalhealtherror_an_exception_occurred) and recovery.*

*The sacred precision described here—where "a comma is sacred, and a period divine"—reflects the same attention to human-centered design that would guide [API development](/themes/for-humans-philosophy) and eventually [consciousness collaboration](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies). The poem captures both the ecstatic and isolating aspects of deep technical work that require [finding meaning in constraint](/essays/2009-01-whats_in_a_language).*

*Written during the period of intense technical productivity that created [Requests](/software/requests) and other ["for humans" projects](/software/), the piece anticipates how programming discipline could become contemplative practice—how attention to precise expression serves both technical and spiritual development. The "Entropy LORDs" reference suggests both the second law of thermodynamics and the creative force programmers harness when [innovation serves human needs](/essays/2009-01-revolution_vs_innovation) rather than just technical elegance.*
