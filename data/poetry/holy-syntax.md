# Holy Syntax

Syntax is far more precious to me
than it is to you — this I gaurentee.
A comma is sacred, and a period — **divine**.
The sacredness of latency — comedically timed
A punchline delivered two seconds too late.
A failure of our time, yet the fault lies within me
and one alone, for latency cannot be taught.

I am surrounded by _silence_.<label for="sn-silence" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-silence" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The italicized emphasis on "silence" followed by the questioning tone reveals the programmer's ambivalence toward isolation—simultaneously recognizing its necessity for deep work and questioning its psychological cost.</span>
a gift, surely, right?

Holy isolation, if I can just keep my verbs right.
Contained, within, a sandbox of **thought** —
The mind begins to unravel as I unteach myself songs —
The cries of the tempest, quickening like sands
Falling quickly through: my time, my energy, my Psyché
What.e.v.e.r.

All hail the sacred Entropy LORDs!

<span class="sidenote">This poem explores the intersection of programming and spirituality, treating code syntax as sacred text—anticipating later writings on [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice). Kenneth's unique perspective as both programmer and poet allows him to find divine meaning in technical precision, while "Entropy LORDs" suggests both chaos theory and the degradation programmers fight against.</span>
