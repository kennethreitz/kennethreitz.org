# Labyrinth

Hark!
Babel's trumpets have sounded, the churchbells have sung,
The rules, a new, greet us with a fresh perspective.

The labyrinth, a maze of the mind,
We're all compartmentalized, you and I.

The walls are high, and the path is long,
A Hero's Journey awaits us all.

Together, in seperateness, we sing our song!
The song of the labyrinth, the song of the soul.

So Sing, Beloved, Sing! Let your voice ring outwards
If I could, I would shout.

Right out of this screen, right out of this text.
A Hyperlink to my own mind, a temple at rest.

Ignite my fire, and set me ablaze!
It's the only fucking way we'll get out of this maze.
