# Labyrinth

Hark!

Babel's trumpets have sounded<label for="sn-babel" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-babel" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The Tower of Babel represents humanity's attempt to reach the divine, resulting in confusion of tongues—a metaphor for the fragmentation of communication and understanding.</span>, the churchbells have sung,
The rules, a new, greet us with a fresh perspective.

The labyrinth, a maze of the mind,
We're all compartmentalized, you and I.

The walls are high, and the path is long,
A Hero's Journey<label for="sn-heroes-journey" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-heroes-journey" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Joseph Campbell's monomyth structure describing the archetypal journey of transformation: departure, initiation, and return—a pattern found across mythologies and personal growth narratives.</span> awaits us all.

Together, in seperateness, we sing our song!
The song of the labyrinth, the song of the soul.

So Sing, Beloved, Sing! Let your voice ring outwards
If I could, I would shout.

Right out of this screen, right out of this text.
A Hyperlink to my own mind, a temple at rest.

Ignite my fire, and set me ablaze!
It's the only fucking way we'll get out of this maze.
