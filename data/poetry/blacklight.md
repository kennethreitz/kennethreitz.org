# The Blacklight

the blacklight prevails
revealing all transcendence
in a precious of gnosis
i am endued with spirit
my friend
i am so sorry for the complications
in our past

<span class="sidenote">The blacklight metaphor suggests hidden truths revealed under ultraviolet illuminationâ€”things invisible in ordinary light become apparent. The poem combines spiritual imagery with personal confession, using the blacklight as a symbol for gnosis and divine revelation that exposes both transcendence and regret.</span>
