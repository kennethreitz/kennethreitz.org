the blacklight prevails
revealing all transcendence
in a precious of gnosis<label for="sn-gnosis" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Gnosis, from ancient Greek meaning "knowledge," refers to spiritual insight or direct experience of the divine—here presented as something revealed rather than learned, emphasizing illumination over intellectual understanding.</span>
i am endued with spirit
my friend
i am so sorry for the complications
in our past

<span class="sidenote">The blacklight metaphor suggests hidden truths revealed under ultraviolet illumination—things invisible in ordinary light become apparent. The poem combines spiritual imagery with personal confession, using the blacklight as a symbol for gnosis and divine revelation that exposes both transcendence and regret.</span>
