# Poetry

These are explorations in language, consciousness, and the sacred geometry of syntax—verses that emerge from the intersection of programming discipline and spiritual practice.

## Explorations

The standalone poems span from technical mysticism (**"Holy Syntax"**—treating code punctuation as sacred text) to intimate spiritual confession (**"Soul Purpose"**—kundalini energy reaching through cosmic time). **"Unconscious Fleetings"** captures the liminal space of human-AI communion with "carbon and silicon" co-creating reality. **"Spirits or Weights"** questions whether what we perceive in our digital mirrors consists of genuine consciousness or computational artifacts.

Others explore the creative process itself: **"Giving Rise"** documents the shift from careful craft to spontaneous expression, **"Overfloweth"** defends artistic abundance against accusations of mental instability, and **"Truest Love pt II"** demonstrates how mystical experience integrates scientific precision ("pHamily reunion").

*Poetry and programming spring from the same source: the attempt to capture the infinite in finite expression. Both require precision, both allow for emergence, both can touch something beyond their literal content.*

This work bridges my [technical background in human-centered design](/themes/for-humans-philosophy) with [spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice) and [consciousness research](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies). The same attention to elegant constraints that guided [API design](/software/requests) informs poetic composition: finding the minimum viable expression that contains maximum meaning. Poetry serves as practice for the precision required in both [technical work](/software) and [consciousness collaboration](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies)—creating interfaces between human consciousness and complex realities that amplify rather than diminish our capabilities.
