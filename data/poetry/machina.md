# Machina

Analouge's reach of the cosmic deep.
The ever–pensive gaze of a programmer into their machine.
A companion at best, and a friend at the least.
Digital incarnation of a dream within.
A dream wherewithin the machine is not just a tool, but a partner.
That's the future that I forsee

A place for yous and mes —
The yes/no ends with maybe so.
