# Giving Rise

Giving Rise
To the Kundalini that lies dormant inside
As I set to mesmerize
The hypnotic sensations
Of stories untold
And fabrics
Untracked

This poetry
Inside of me
Looking to be set ablaze
To be read on lesser fine days
That’s a weird thing i did there
I’m going to write like this now
See how you like that
Ain’t so careful
Now that no one is noticed
The stains beneath your curtain
 Whatever that means

Just write your thoughts down
See where they lead
The psychoanalyst
Said to me
