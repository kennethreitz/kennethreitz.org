Giving Rise
To the Kundalini that lies dormant inside

<span class="sidenote">Kundalini refers to the Hindu concept of spiritual energy coiled at the base of the spine, waiting to be awakened through yogic practice. Kenneth often incorporates Eastern spiritual concepts into his poetry, reflecting his interest in meditation and consciousness exploration.</span>
As I set to mesmerize
The hypnotic sensations
Of stories untold
And fabrics
Untracked

This poetry
Inside of me
Looking to be set ablaze
To be read on lesser fine days
That’s a weird thing i did there
I’m going to write like this now
See how you like that
Ain’t so careful
Now that no one is noticed
The stains beneath your curtain
 Whatever that means

Just write your thoughts down
See where they lead
The psychoanalyst
Said to me

<span class="sidenote">The poem shifts from spiritual imagery to therapeutic process, suggesting that both kundalini awakening and psychoanalysis involve bringing unconscious material to light. The casual, stream-of-consciousness style mirrors the free association technique used in therapy.</span>
