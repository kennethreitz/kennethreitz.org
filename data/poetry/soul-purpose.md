# Soul Purpose


Kundalini is Rising,
from the base of my spine
to far beyond imagination


Reaching deep into the farthest reaches
of the cosmos,
into the web of human history,
mystery,
all things previous and sacred.

And what a privilege it is, witnessing the act of creation itself!

My Caduceus,
the two serpents
weaving the key to truth
throughout the ages,
heals all, and it's weight is immense —
yet it is light as a feather

<span class="sidenote">The Caduceus, Mercury's staff with two intertwining serpents, symbolizes healing and transformation. In esoteric traditions, it represents the balance of opposing forces and the awakening of spiritual consciousness. Kenneth connects this ancient symbol to his own role as a creator and healer through code.</span>

the sword of truth,
programming the minds of
centuries and yugas beyond —
into the deepest portals of mine soul

<span class="sidenote">Yugas are vast time cycles in Hindu cosmology—each lasting thousands of years. Kenneth's use of "programming" creates a bridge between ancient spiritual concepts and modern technology, suggesting that code and consciousness operate on similar principles across cosmic time scales.</span>
