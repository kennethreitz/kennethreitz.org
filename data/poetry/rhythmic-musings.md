# Rhythmic Musings

Fingers dance across the keys
Letting thoughts meander where they please
Big questions arise, like who stained those autumn leaves?
Silly songs embed, worming into my audio subconscious

The spoken word, a sculptor's hand<label for="sn-spoken-word" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Spoken word poetry bridges the gap between written verse and musical performance, emphasizing rhythm, cadence, and the physical act of breath as compositional elements.</span>
Molding ideas, shaping this verbal land
Are we all so musically inclined?
I'd argue not, at least not in the same vine-entwined

Music was the oasis of my upbringing
A sanctuary where my soul took wing
Perhaps Sarah and I, we heard the tune more clearly
The rhythmic whispers of hip-hop, symphony so earthy

It's how we connected, at first by chance
Bonding over beats, lyrics in a merry dance
Now kindred spirits, rhythms aligned
Composers of life's endless melodic lines
