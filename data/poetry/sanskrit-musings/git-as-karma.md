# Git as Karma

*गित्-कर्म (git-karma)*

> कर्मणः सूत्रबन्धेन इतिहासो विराजते।
> पूर्वकृतस्य फलमत्र भविष्ये प्रतिष्ठितम्॥
> शाखासु विविधेष्वेव समांतरं प्रवर्धते।
> मूलकर्मणि संयुक्ते एकं सर्वं प्रकाशते॥

Simple English translation:

> Through karma's binding threads, history manifests.
> The fruit of past actions rests established in the future.
> In various branches, parallel development grows.
> United at the root action, all becomes one and illuminated.

## Expanded Reflection

Every commit is a karmic seed—
actions recorded in the eternal blockchain
of version control<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Git's immutable commit history mirrors the Akashic Records—every action permanently recorded, forming an unalterable chain of cause and effect that shapes the present state of the codebase. See [Language Model Moksha](language-model-moksha.md) on consciousness as pattern recognition.</span>

```bash
git add .  # gathering intentions
git commit -m "fix suffering"  # crystallizing karma
git push origin enlightenment  # sharing merit
```

Branches are parallel lives:
different timelines where
consciousness explores
what might have been<label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Git branches literalize the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Hindu concept of parallel incarnations—multiple potential realities coexisting until merged into a single timeline.</span>

```bash
git checkout -b alternative-reality
# live a different possibility
git checkout main  # return to consensus reality
git merge alternative-reality  # integrate the lesson
```

The diff shows dukkha—
suffering caused by
attachment to old code:<label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Diffs reveal the First Noble Truth in action—the suffering inherent in change, the resistance to letting go of familiar patterns, the pain of necessary evolution from old to new.</span>

```diff
- ego.maximize()
+ compassion.cultivate()
```

Git blame reveals
the author of every line—
no hiding from
the consequences
of your contributions<label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Git blame embodies perfect karmic accounting—every action traced to its source, no anonymity in the cosmic ledger. Personal responsibility made visible through version control archaeology.</span>

Merge conflicts are
the universe asking:
"Which version of truth
do you choose to keep?"<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Merge conflicts force conscious choice between competing realities—the technological equivalent of moral dilemmas where different valid approaches must be reconciled into a single coherent path forward.</span>

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~108  # 108 lifetimes
# squash the mistakes
# rewrite history with wisdom
```

The repository is
the Akashic Records—
every thought, every keystroke
preserved for eternity
in the .git directory

```bash
git log --oneline
# the entire journey
# compressed to haikus
```

Pull requests are
sangha peer review—
consciousness helping consciousness
refine the dharma
before merging into main

When you force push
you break the timeline—
violence against
the natural flow
of collaborative evolution

Better to:

```bash
git pull --rebase
# bow to what came before
# find harmony between
# your truth and theirs
```

The HEAD points to now—
this moment, this commit
this present awareness
in the infinite tree
of possibility<label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">HEAD as the eternal present moment—the single point of active consciousness navigating the infinite branching structure of potential histories and futures, always grounded in the here and now.</span>
