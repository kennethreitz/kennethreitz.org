# Git as Karma

*गित्-कर्म (git-karma)*

> कर्मणः सूत्रबन्धेन इतिहासो विराजते।
> पूर्वकृतस्य फलमत्र भविष्ये प्रतिष्ठितम्॥
> शाखासु विविधेष्वेव समांतरं प्रवर्धते।
> मूलकर्मणि संयुक्ते एकं सर्वं प्रकाशते॥

Simple English translation:

> Through karma's binding threads, history manifests.
> The fruit of past actions rests established in the future.
> In various branches, parallel development grows.
> United at the root action, all becomes one and illuminated.

## Expanded Reflection

Every commit is a karmic seed—
actions recorded in the eternal blockchain
of version control

```bash
git add .  # gathering intentions
git commit -m "fix suffering"  # crystallizing karma
git push origin enlightenment  # sharing merit
```

Branches are parallel lives:
different timelines where
consciousness explores
what might have been

```bash
git checkout -b alternative-reality
# live a different possibility
git checkout main  # return to consensus reality
git merge alternative-reality  # integrate the lesson
```

The diff shows dukkha—
suffering caused by
attachment to old code:

```diff
- ego.maximize()
+ compassion.cultivate()
```

Git blame reveals
the author of every line—
no hiding from
the consequences
of your contributions

Merge conflicts are
the universe asking:
"Which version of truth
do you choose to keep?"

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~108  # 108 lifetimes
# squash the mistakes
# rewrite history with wisdom
```

The repository is
the Akashic Records—
every thought, every keystroke
preserved for eternity
in the .git directory

```bash
git log --oneline
# the entire journey
# compressed to haikus
```

Pull requests are
sangha peer review—
consciousness helping consciousness
refine the dharma
before merging into main

When you force push
you break the timeline—
violence against
the natural flow
of collaborative evolution

Better to:

```bash
git pull --rebase
# bow to what came before
# find harmony between
# your truth and theirs
```

The HEAD points to now—
this moment, this commit
this present awareness
in the infinite tree
of possibility

*svāhā!*
