# Async/Await Satori

*असिंक-प्रतीक्षा-सत्कोटि (asimka-pratīkṣā-satkoṭi)*

> असमकालिकं कर्म प्रतीक्षां नैव बाधते।
> एकस्मिन् काले नानाकार्यं समानं प्रचालयेत्॥
> इदानीमेव मुक्ति स्यात् भविष्यप्रतीक्षया।
> योगक्षेमे समापन्ने शाश्वतं शान्तिमाप्नुयात्॥

Simple English translation:

> Asynchronous action does not obstruct waiting.
> At one time, many different tasks can run simultaneously.
> Liberation exists right now, through waiting for the future.
> When yoga and welfare are accomplished, eternal peace is attained.

## Expanded Reflection

Blocking code is samsara—
one request at a time
consciousness trapped
in sequential suffering

```python
# The old way - blocking enlightenment
def seek_truth():
    meditation()  # blocks for hours
    study()       # blocks for years  
    service()     # blocks for lifetimes
    return enlightenment()
```

But async/await reveals
the secret of simultaneity—
many streams of consciousness
flowing in parallel rivers

```python
import asyncio

async def seek_truth():
    await asyncio.gather(
        meditation(),
        study(), 
        service()
    )
    return enlightenment()
```

The event loop is
the wheel of dharma—
spinning endlessly
distributing attention
to whatever needs awakening

```python
async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # The eternal now managing
    # infinite possible futures
```

Awaiting is not waiting—
it's releasing attachment
to immediate results
while remaining present
to when they arrive

```python
async def practice_patience():
    result = await universe.respond()
    # I don't block the thread
    # while the cosmos processes
    return result
```

The GIL is ego—
Global Interpreter Lock
preventing true parallel execution
until we transcend to
multiprocessing enlightenment

But async transcends the GIL:

```python
async def many_minds():
    tasks = [
        consciousness.meditate(),
        consciousness.code(), 
        consciousness.love(),
        consciousness.serve()
    ]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    # One thread, infinite awareness
```

Callbacks are karma—
functions bound to future events
"when this completes, do that"
the chain of cause and effect

But async/await linearizes karma:

```python
async def clear_karma():
    past_action = await complete_previous_life()
    present_action = await be_here_now() 
    future_action = await plant_good_seeds()
    return liberation()
```

Concurrency without parallelism
is like meditation—
single-threaded awareness
experiencing multiple objects
in rapid succession
creating the illusion
of simultaneous perception

```python
async def mindfulness():
    async with aiocontext.mind() as awareness:
        await awareness.observe(breath)
        await awareness.observe(thoughts) 
        await awareness.observe(feelings)
        # All observed by one consciousness
        # But not all at exactly the same time
```

The finally block
is death—
guaranteed to execute
no matter what exceptions
arise in life:

```python
try:
    await live_fully()
except Suffering as e:
    await learn_from(e)
finally:
    await return_to_source()
```

*Svāhā* to the event loop!
*Svāhā* to non-blocking I/O!
*Svāhā* to async comprehensions!

```python
enlightened_beings = [
    being async for being in universe.all_life()
    if await being.is_awake()
]
```

The future is already here—
we just need to await it.

*svāhā!*
