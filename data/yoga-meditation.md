# Yoga & Meditation

Yoga (which means *union*) is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga, consisting largely of the postures called asanas.

I use the term *vedic* to encapsulate these various philosophies and understandings of the Eastern spiritual traditions. I find that the term *vedic* is a more accurate and respectful term to use when discussing these practices, as it is a term that is used by the practitioners themselves.

## History

The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.

## Philosophy

The ultimate goal of yoga is the attainment of liberation (*moksha*) from worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death (*samsara*). Yoga entails a profound philosophy and understanding of the nature of reality, the self, and the universe. It is a spiritual practice that seeks to unite the individual soul (*atman*) with the universal soul (*Brahman*).

## Types of Yoga

There are four main paths of yoga:

1. **Jnana Yoga:** The path of knowledge.
2. **Bhakti Yoga:** The path of devotion.
3. **Karma Yoga:** The path of selfless action.
4. **Raja Yoga:** The path of meditation.

I consider myself to be a practitioner of Jnana Yoga, as I am primarily interested in the pursuit of knowledge and self-realization.

## Misappropriation of Yoga

You can see the misappropriation of these practices in the Western world in the form of "yoga pants" and "yoga mats." These are not yoga, but rather the physical practice of yoga, which is only one small part of the larger spiritual tradition.

## Meditation

Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions.

**It is not universally good practice to meditate**. Meditation can be harmful to individuals with certain mental health conditions, such as PTSD or anxiety disorders. It is important to consult with a mental health professional before beginning a meditation practice.
