## Introduction

- **Growing Open Source Seeds** explores different approaches to open source projects, highlighting the evolution and challenges in the community, particularly focusing on the philosophy and sustainability of open source contributions.

## Public vs. Open Source

- **Public Source:**
  - Code is released with an open source license, but it may not be actively maintained or developed.
  - Often abandoned due to lack of interest or burnout.

- **Gittip Example:**
  - An extreme open source project with shared ownership and transparency.
  - Major decisions are made through community involvement on platforms like GitHub.
  - Represents a "shared investment" model where contributors actively participate in the project's development.

## Dictatorship Projects

- **Requests as a Dictatorship Project:**
  - A "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL) manages the project, making all key decisions.
  - While community feedback is encouraged, there is no expectation that it will influence decisions.
  - Benefits include quick iteration and maintaining a strong vision, but it carries risks like low bus-factor and high burnout potential.

## Lessons in Open Source

- **Contributors:**
  - Interactions with maintainers should be respectful and appreciative of their time and effort.

- **Maintainers:**
  - Must be thankful to contributors, choose words carefully, and educate users, particularly those new to open source.

## Avoiding Burnout

- **Sustainability:**
  - Open source is challenging to sustain due to time constraints and the risk of becoming a bottleneck in oneâ€™s own projects.
  - Emphasizes the importance of purpose, mastery, and autonomy in maintaining motivation.

- **Delegation:**
  - Leveraging a team to handle issues and pull requests can help maintainers focus on larger issues, improving sustainability.

## The Power of Saying No

- **Simplicity Over Functionality:**
  - Maintain simplicity by rejecting features or pull requests that add unnecessary complexity.
  - Simple code is easier to maintain, while complex code leads to technical debt and higher maintenance burdens.

## Conclusion

- **Open Source Philosophy:**
  - Open source should make the world a better place without adding unnecessary complexity.
  - Focus on simplicity, sustainability, and maintaining a clear vision to ensure long-term success in open source projects.
