## Introduction
- **Author:** Kenneth Reitz
- **Focus:** Simplifying Python for everyday developers.
- **Motivation:** Provide practical tools and packages to make Python more human-friendly.

<span class="sidenote">This talk established Kenneth as a thought leader in Python developer experience. The "for Humans" philosophy became a movement that influenced countless Python libraries and frameworks, emphasizing that software should serve humans, not the other way around.</span>

## Key Projects
- **Requests:** HTTP for Humans.
- **Httpbin.org:** An HTTP request & response service.
- **Other Projects:**
  - Legit: Git workflow for Humans.
  - Envoy: Subprocess for Humans.
  - Tablib: Tabular data for Humans.
  - Clint: CLI app toolkit.
  - Autoenv: Magic shell environments.

## Philosophy
- **Python Zen:** Emphasizes simplicity and clarity.
- **Key Tenets:**
  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.

## The Problem with Existing Tools
- **Complexity:** Traditional Python libraries like `urllib2` are overly complex.
- **Accessibility:** Difficult APIs deter new users and frustrate experienced ones.

<span class="sidenote">The urllib2 criticism became legendary in the Python community. Kenneth's articulation of its flaws helped developers understand that complexity isn't a necessary evil—it's a design choice that can be avoided with careful API planning.</span>

## The Solution: Requests
- **Design Principles:**
  - Consistent and simple API.
  - Methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with intuitive parameters.
- **Success:** Widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## The Importance of API Design
- **User-Centric:** APIs should cater to the 90% use case.
- **Documentation:** A well-written README is crucial for adoption.
- **Evolution:** Features can grow, but the API should remain simple.

<span class="sidenote">The "90% use case" principle revolutionized how Python developers think about API design. Rather than trying to handle every edge case in the primary interface, successful libraries focus on making common tasks trivial while providing escape hatches for complex scenarios.</span>

## Barriers to Python Adoption
- **Installation:** Confusion around Python versions and installation methods.
- **Standard Library Issues:** Complex modules for simple tasks.
- **Dependency Management:** Complicated packaging and installation processes.

## The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python
- **Purpose:** Document best practices and simplify Python adoption.
- **Content:**
  - Installation guides for different OS.
  - Best practices for Python development.
  - A guidebook for both newcomers and experienced developers.

## Manifesto
- **Goals:**
  - Simplify terrible APIs.
  - Document and share best practices with the community.

## Conclusion
- **Call to Action:** Developers should prioritize creating simple, accessible APIs and contribute to open-source projects.
