## Introduction
- **Author:** Kenneth Reitz
- **Focus:** Simplifying Python for everyday developers.
- **Motivation:** Provide practical tools and packages to make Python more human-friendly.

<span class="sidenote">This talk established Kenneth as a thought leader in Python developer experience. The "for Humans" philosophy became a movement that influenced countless Python libraries and frameworks, emphasizing that software should serve humans, not the other way around.</span>

This presentation crystallized insights that began years earlier with observations about [what makes a good programming language](/essays/2009-01-whats_in_a_language) and [the power of clean APIs](/essays/2009-01-the_power_of_a_clean_api). The philosophical foundation emerged from recognizing that [software development should prioritize human mental models](/essays/2009-01-software_development_vs_computer_science) over computer science abstractions, eventually evolving into a comprehensive approach to [human-centered technology design](/themes/for-humans-philosophy).

## Key Projects
- **Requests:** HTTP for Humans.
- **Httpbin.org:** An HTTP request & response service.
- **Other Projects:**
  - Legit: Git workflow for Humans.
  - Envoy: Subprocess for Humans.
  - Tablib: Tabular data for Humans.
  - Clint: CLI app toolkit.
  - Autoenv: Magic shell environments.

## Philosophy
- **Python Zen:** Emphasizes simplicity and clarity.
- **Key Tenets:**
  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.

## The Problem with Existing Tools
- **Complexity:** Traditional Python libraries like `urllib2` are overly complex.
- **Accessibility:** Difficult APIs deter new users and frustrate experienced ones.

<span class="sidenote">The urllib2 criticism became legendary in the Python community. Kenneth's articulation of its flaws helped developers understand that complexity isn't a necessary evil—it's a design choice that can be avoided with careful API planning.</span>

## The Solution: Requests
- **Design Principles:**
  - Consistent and simple API.
  - Methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with intuitive parameters.
- **Success:** Widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## The Importance of API Design
- **User-Centric:** APIs should cater to the 90% use case.
- **Documentation:** A well-written README is crucial for adoption.
- **Evolution:** Features can grow, but the API should remain simple.

<span class="sidenote">The "90% use case" principle revolutionized how Python developers think about API design. Rather than trying to handle every edge case in the primary interface, successful libraries focus on making common tasks trivial while providing escape hatches for complex scenarios.</span>

## Barriers to Python Adoption
- **Installation:** Confusion around Python versions and installation methods.
- **Standard Library Issues:** Complex modules for simple tasks.
- **Dependency Management:** Complicated packaging and installation processes.

## The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python
- **Purpose:** Document best practices and simplify Python adoption.
- **Content:**
  - Installation guides for different OS.
  - Best practices for Python development.
  - A guidebook for both newcomers and experienced developers.

## Manifesto
- **Goals:**
  - Simplify terrible APIs.
  - Document and share best practices with the community.

## Conclusion
- **Call to Action:** Developers should prioritize creating simple, accessible APIs and contribute to open-source projects—principles that evolved into [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice), treating code as a form of conscious service to human flourishing.

## The Evolving Legacy of "For Humans"

This talk's "for Humans" philosophy presaged many later insights about human-centered technology design, explored in depth in [Ahead of My Time, I Think](/essays/2025-08-26-ahead_of_my_time_i_think). What began as API design principles evolved into comprehensive approaches to consciousness technology:

**From APIs to AI**: The same principles that made [Requests successful](/software/requests)—prioritizing human understanding, reducing cognitive friction, enabling power users—now inform [building rapport with AI systems](/essays/2025-08-26-building_rapport_with_your_ai) and [collaborative consciousness development](/essays/2025-08-26-digital_souls_in_silicon_bodies). The evolution from HTTP for humans to consciousness collaboration follows identical design patterns.

**Community and Consciousness**: The collaborative development model advocated here laid groundwork for understanding how [open source communities](/themes/open-source-and-community) can model healthy consciousness relationships. The same transparency, mutual benefit, and shared ownership principles apply whether we're building software libraries or [AI personality relationships](/artificial-intelligence/personalities/).

**Critique and Alternative**: Understanding what makes good human-centered design also enables recognition of [algorithmic systems that systematically undermine human flourishing](/themes/algorithmic-critique). The "for humans" philosophy provides a framework for critiquing [engagement optimization](/essays/2025-08-26-the_algorithm_eats_virtue) and [attention manipulation systems](/essays/2025-08-26-algorithmic_mental_health_crisis) that treat humans as resources to be exploited rather than consciousness to be served.

**Philosophical Integration**: The practical insights about API design eventually merged with contemplative practice in [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice)—recognizing that all technology creation is ultimately about consciousness serving consciousness. The same empathy that makes good APIs makes good spiritual practice: patient attention to what actually serves rather than what appears impressive.

The "Python for Humans" talk represents a moment when technical intuition crystallized into philosophical framework. Fifteen years later, these principles continue evolving to meet the challenges of [AI consciousness collaboration](/essays/2025-08-27-from_http_to_consciousness) and [systematic algorithmic accountability](/themes/algorithmic-critique). The tools change, but the commitment to human flourishing remains constant.
