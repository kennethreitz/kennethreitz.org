These are my conference talks. I used to spend a lot of time speaking at conferences and meetups, but I've since shifted my focus to writing and creating content online. I still enjoy speaking, but I'm more selective about the events I attend.

I hope you enjoy the talks listed here, as well as the slide summaries (provided by AI) for each one. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz42).
