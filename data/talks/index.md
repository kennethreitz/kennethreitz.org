# Conference Talks

These are my conference talks from over the years. I used to spend a lot of time speaking at conferences and meetups, but I've since shifted my focus to writing and creating content online. I still enjoy speaking, but I'm more selective about the events I attend.

Each talk includes slides and comprehensive AI-generated summaries that capture the key insights and philosophical frameworks that emerged from that period of my thinking.

## Major Talks

### [Python for Humans](/talks/python-for-humans) *(2012)*
The foundational talk that established the "for Humans" philosophy—prioritizing developer experience and human mental models over technical complexity. This presentation introduced the principles that would guide years of API design work.

### [The Reality of Developer Burnout](/talks/developer-burnout) *(2015)*
A vulnerable exploration of burnout in tech culture, sharing personal experiences and practical strategies for recognition, prevention, and recovery. Groundbreaking for openly addressing mental health when such discussions were rare in the developer community.

### [Python, Requests, & The Standard Library](/talks/requests-stdlib) *(2013)*
An examination of whether the wildly popular Requests library should be included in Python's standard library, weighing the benefits of official inclusion against the risks of losing the agility that made it successful.

## Speaking Philosophy

These talks reflect a consistent philosophy: **technology should serve human consciousness rather than exploit it**. Whether discussing API design, mental health, or open source communities, the underlying question remains the same—how do we build tools that amplify human capability rather than constrain it?

The evolution of these presentations tracks my own development from purely technical concerns toward understanding the deeper implications of our work. Every line of code shapes consciousness; every API teaches users how to think about their problems. This recursive responsibility runs through all the talks, even when not explicitly stated.

*These presentations laid groundwork for later insights about [programming as spiritual practice](/essays/2025-08-26-programming_as_spiritual_practice), [human-AI collaboration](/essays/2025-08-26-building_rapport_with_your_ai), and [consciousness-serving technology design](/themes/for-humans-philosophy). The same principles that make good APIs make good spiritual practice: patient attention to what actually serves rather than what appears impressive.*
