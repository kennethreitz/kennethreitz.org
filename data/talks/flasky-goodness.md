### Introduction
Kenneth Reitz contrasts Flask and Django, focusing on the benefits of Flask for building modular, maintainable web services.

### Key Concepts
- **Django Overview**: While Django provides a robust framework with many built-in features, it often leads to tightly coupled, monolithic applications.
- **Flask Overview**: Flask offers simplicity and flexibility, making it ideal for building small, composable services. It has fewer built-in features, but this allows for greater customization and modularity.

### Conclusion
Flask is a powerful tool for developers who value simplicity and flexibility over the extensive, opinionated features of Django.
