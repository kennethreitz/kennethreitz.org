This website is a work–in–progress; it is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and projects with the world. Thanks for stopping by!

I am a [software engineer](/software), [writer](/essays), and [speaker](/talks), and I am passionate about technology, open source, and education. Previously, I was very interested in [photography](/photos) and [music](/music) as well.

I am known mostly for my open–source creations, such a [Requests](/software/requests) and [Pipenv](/software/pipenv).

In the past, I worked at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as the Python Language Owner, and I am currently looking for a new role. Please [reach out](/contact) if your team is looking for someone to join!
