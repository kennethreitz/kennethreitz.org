This website is a work–in–progress; it is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and projects with the world.
Thanks for stopping by!

I am a [software engineer](/software), [writer](/essays), and [speaker](/talks), and I am passionate about technology, open source, and education.
Previously, I was very interested in [photography](/photos) and [music](/music) as well.

Previously,
I worked at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and I am currently a Staff Engineer at [The C++ Alliance](https://cppalliance.org/), where
