# My Family

The proudest achievement of my life is my family.

I am blessed to have a loving wife and three wonderful children. They are my source of strength, inspiration, and joy. My wife is my partner in life, and together we have built a happy and harmonious home for our children. My children are the light of my life, and I am grateful for the opportunity to watch them grow and develop into amazing individuals.

One of the children, Malachi, is biologically mine. He is a bright, energetic, and curious — and a constant source of inspiration and joy. He is currently 2 years old.

Sometimes, I wish we could all just stay in this moment forever.
