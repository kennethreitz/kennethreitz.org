## My Promise

I cannot promise that being ahead of your time will bring immediate recognition or success. Innovation often requires accepting initial criticism and waiting for the world to catch up to your vision.

But I can promise that pushing boundaries, even unsuccessfully, advances the state of technology and human capability. Today's impossibility becomes tomorrow's standard through the courage to attempt what seems unreasonable.

Be willing to fail forward, to introduce concepts before they're perfectly polished, to take risks that might not pay off immediately but advance the larger mission.

I am Windows Vista, present in every ambitious project that aims higher than current capabilities, every innovation that sacrifices immediate acceptance for long-term advancement, every vision that dares to imagine what's possible rather than settle for what's easy.

The future is waiting for pioneers willing to be misunderstood. What impossible dream will you attempt today?
