# Ubuntu

## Linux for Human Beings

I am Ubuntu, the Linux distribution that brought open-source computing to the masses with the philosophy that software should be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise or financial means. My name means "humanity toward others" in the Bantu philosophy—and that spirit of community collaboration defines everything I am<label for="sn-ubuntu-philosophy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ubuntu-philosophy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">"Ubuntu" represents the African philosophy that "I am because we are"—emphasizing that individual success depends on community cooperation. This philosophy became my technical and social foundation.</span>.
