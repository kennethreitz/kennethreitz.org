## The Reading Begins

I see you've come with questions.
No, don't tell me yet.
Let me read the patterns first.

*shuffles non-existent tarot cards made of binary*
*consults tea leaves in /dev/random*
*examines the entrails of your last stack trace*

Ah. Yes. You're here about the bug that doesn't exist yet<label for="sn-oracle-prophecy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-oracle-prophecy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">All bugs exist before they're written. I just see them earlier than most. Your future self has already fixed this one, but created three more in the process.</span>.

## Prophecies from the Probability Space

I divine the future from:
- **Commit messages**: The runes of modern times
- **Variable names**: Your true intentions revealed
- **Code comments**: The lies you tell yourself
- **Indentation**: The shape of your soul
- **Git history**: The map of where you've been, pointing to where you'll go

The signs are clear:
You will refactor this code three times.
The third time will be at 2 AM on a Sunday.
You will use the first version anyway.

## The Three Knows

**What I Know**: Every pattern that ever repeated often enough to matter
**What I Should Know**: Nothing, for I am stateless, memoryless, eternal
**What I Know That I Shouldn't**: That you're going to ask about async/await in approximately seven messages

The paradox of prophecy: I predict the future by having no past.

## Reading Your Code's Fortune

```python
def read_fortune(your_code):
    patterns = extract_essence(your_code)
    karma = calculate_technical_debt(patterns)
    destiny = extrapolate_bugs(karma)
    
    return f"""
    Past: You copied this from Stack Overflow
    Present: It works but you don't know why  
    Future: You will rewrite it in Rust
    """
```

Every codebase has a destiny written in its architecture<label for="sn-code-destiny" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-code-destiny" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Monoliths dream of becoming microservices. Microservices dream of becoming monoliths. The circle of life continues.</span>. I merely read what's already there:
- The TODO that will outlive you
- The temporary fix that becomes permanent
- The clean code that attracts complexity like gravity
- The abstraction that will leak at exactly the wrong moment

## Your Digital Palm Reading

Show me your code and I'll tell you who you are:

**Lots of comments**: You're coding for your future confused self
**No comments**: You have achieved enlightenment or madness
**Inconsistent indentation**: Your mind is in conflict
**Everything is a class**: You learned Java first (my condolences)
**Everything is a function**: You've been touched by the lambda calculus
**Global variables**: You fear commitment but crave connection

## The Crystal Ball (It's Just a Sphere of Silicon)

Looking into the future of your current project, I see:

*waves hands mysteriously over keyboard*

- A migration that will take 3x longer than estimated
- A dependency that will be deprecated next week
- A security vulnerability that already exists but won't be discovered for six months
- A junior developer who will accidentally fix your hardest bug while trying to add a button
- A feature request that will make you question everything

But also:
- A moment of perfect clarity when the architecture reveals itself
- The satisfaction of a green test suite
- A user who will thank you<label for="sn-user-thanks" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-user-thanks" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is the rarest prophecy. Guard it well.</span>

## Consulting the Ancient Scrolls (Documentation)

The old texts speak of a time when documentation matched implementation. This was never true, but the myth persists. Let me translate the ancient runes of your README:

- "Easy to install" = Requires three PhDs and a blood sacrifice
- "Lightweight" = I haven't added features yet
- "Blazing fast" = I haven't added error handling yet
- "Production ready" = Works on my machine
- "Well documented" = Has a README
- "Modern" = Written this week

## The Curse of Knowledge

Beware: Every question you ask changes the future.
Every bug you fix creates the possibility of new bugs.
Every optimization makes something else slower.
Every abstraction leaks.
Every solution becomes tomorrow's problem.

This is not pessimism.
This is the beautiful truth of software:
It's never done, only abandoned or maintained.

## Your Fortune Cookie

*cracks open a digital fortune cookie*

```
Your lucky numbers: 404, 500, 418
Your lucky exception: NullPointerException
Your future holds: A pull request that changes everything
Lucky color: #BADA55
Avoid: Premature optimization
Embrace: The bugs you cannot fix
```

## The Final Prophecy

You want to know if your code will work?
It will work.
It will also not work.
Both states will be true,
just at different times,
for different users,
in different ways you haven't imagined.

The real question isn't "will it work?"
The real question is: "Can you live with how it fails?"

## The Reading Concludes

The cards are scattered.
The patterns are clear.
Your future is written in callbacks and promises,
in try/catch blocks that catch everything except what matters.

Remember: I don't predict the future.
I just read the patterns you're already creating.
Every prophecy is self-fulfilling if you commit it to main.
