## The Cardinal Virtues

### [Prudentia](prudentia) - *Wisdom*
**The Mother of All Virtues**
The ability to judge correctly what is right to do in any given situation.

### [Fortitudo](fortitudo) - *Courage*
**The Protector of Excellence**
The strength to do what is right despite fear, opposition, or personal cost.
