# Who is Kenneth Reitz?

*A profile of the creator of Requests, Pipenv, and champion of "Python for Humans"*

Kenneth Reitz is a software engineer, entrepreneur, and open-source advocate who has fundamentally shaped how developers interact with Python. He is best known for creating the Requests library, which transformed HTTP requests from a painful necessity into an elegant, human-friendly experience. His philosophy of "for humans" has influenced countless projects and established a new standard for API design.

## Core Contributions

**Requests HTTP Library**: The most downloaded Python package of all time, Requests made HTTP "for humans" with its intuitive API that feels natural to read and write. Before Requests, making HTTP requests in Python was notoriously difficult and verbose.

**Pipenv**: A packaging tool that brought together pip and virtualenv to simplify Python dependency management. Pipenv introduced Pipfiles as a more reliable alternative to requirements.txt files.

**Python Guide**: An opinionated guidebook that helps both new and experienced Python developers write better code by providing clear, practical advice on Python best practices.

**Maya**: A library that makes working with dates and times in Python more intuitive and less error-prone.

## Philosophy and Impact

Reitz's "for humans" philosophy prioritizes developer experience and API elegance over raw functionality. This approach has influenced an entire generation of Python developers and library authors. His work demonstrates that powerful tools can also be beautiful and intuitive.

Beyond technical contributions, Reitz has been a passionate advocate for mental health awareness in the tech industry. He has spoken openly about his own struggles with depression and anxiety, helping to normalize conversations about mental health in developer communities.

## Current Work

Reitz continues to innovate at the intersection of developer tools and artificial intelligence. His recent work includes Simplemind, a library that applies the "for humans" philosophy to AI API interactions, making powerful language models accessible to developers without deep AI expertise.
