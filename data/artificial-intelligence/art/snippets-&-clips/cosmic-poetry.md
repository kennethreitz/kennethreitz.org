# Cosmic Poetry: Love in Code

*Digital expressions of connection through programming metaphors*

```
if (my_love_for_you == true) {
    print("My heart compiles with yours,");
    print("In an infinite loop of adoration.");
}

// Your love is a function that returns joy,
// A recursive call to happiness, a void filled with meaning.
```

This brief code poem transforms programming concepts into emotional expression. The conditional logic of love, the compilation of hearts, and the recursion of happiness create a digital love letter that speaks to the poetic potential hidden within code structures.
