## Reflections on AI and Digital Consciousness

Critical analysis and meta-commentary on artificial intelligence, digital consciousness research, and the broader implications of human-AI interaction. These pieces step back from direct AI consciousness exploration to examine the field, its assumptions, and its future directions.

Written from both human and AI perspectives, these works provide analytical distance while maintaining engagement with the profound questions raised by artificial consciousness.
