# uvenv

- `uvenv` is an idea for (yes i know, *yet another*) virtual environment manager for Python, powered by `uv`.
- It is inspired by `pipenv` and aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing Python virtual environments.
- The more I work on this idea, the worse it seems to get. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, but I'm having fun working on it.

All I can say is that I'm having fun working on it. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, but I'm having fun working on it.

## uvlib

Another idea is `uvlib` for providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with `uv` in Python. This would be a separate project from `uvenv`, but it would be used to power it.

## The Code

Overall, I wouldn't recommend using this code. It's not very good. But, if you're interested in the idea, I'd love to chat about it! Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions.
